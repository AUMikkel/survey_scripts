Current Simulation Optimization (SO) systems struggle with the flexibility needed for quick reconfiguration, often requiring time-consuming, resource-intensive efforts to develop custom models. To address this limitation, this study introduces an innovative SO design strategy that integrates three flexible simulation modeling techniques—template-based, structural modeling, and parameterization. The goal of this integrated design strategy is to enable the rapid adaptation of SO systems to diverse production environments without extensive re-engineering. The proposed SO versatility is validated across three manufacturing scenarios (flow shop, job shop, and open shop scheduling) using modified benchmark instances from Taillard’s dataset. The results demonstrate notable effectiveness in optimizing production schedules across these diverse scenarios, enhancing decision-making processes, and reducing SO development efforts. Unlike conventional SO system design, the proposed design framework ensures real-time adaptability, making it highly relevant to the dynamic requirements of Industry 5.0. This strategic integration of flexible modeling techniques supports efficient decision support, minimizes SO development time, and reinforces manufacturing resilience, therefore sustaining competitiveness in modern industrial ecosystems. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","digital twin; discrete event; genetic algorithm; Industry 4.0; Industry 5.0; manufacturing systems; optimization; production scheduling; simulation","","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85213223406"

Two molds in Carbon PA, i.e. PA6 reinforced with 20% by weight short carbon fibers, were realized via fused filament fabrication and subjected to multiple thermal cycles to simulate successive curing operations. Mold distortions were measured using a coordinate measuring machine before and after each heat treatment. Additionally, finite element method (FEM) and life cycle assessment (LCA) analyses were performed to obtain a complete overview of the 3D printed mold use and provide an industrial decision-making tool. Results showed that the mold distortion increases with temperature, and the clamping effect is more pronounced at the mold’s edges, and it is reduced in the center. Irrespective of the thermal cycle temperature, the highest distortion was observed on the upper surface, with reduced deformation on the composite layup plane. FEM simulations confirmed that, following bolt tightening, the molds can resist without critical stress or plastic deformation. LCA analysis demonstrated that 3D-printed molds reduce environmental impact by 18% compared to aluminum ones, leading to more sustainability benefits for low-volume production, making them ideal for prototyping, small batches, or customized components. The potential of 3D-printed molds as a valid alternative to traditional methods to produce low-volume CFRPs was demonstrated. The implications of this study highlight the efficiency and sustainability benefits of 3D printing technology in composite manufacturing, offering a flexible solution for industries where small production runs and customization are critical. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Additive manufacturing; CFRP; FEM; Life cycle assessment; Mold; Thermal cycle","Automotive industry; Concrete construction; Elastomers; Ionomers; Low temperature production; Plastic molds; Process control; Carbon fibre reinforced polymer; Composite mold; Comprehensive evaluation; Element method; Environmental behavior; Life cycle assessment analysis; Mechanical behavior; Polymer components; Thermal; Thermal cycle; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85208916999"

Despite notable progress, current production scheduling methods for human-robot collaboration (HRC) still fail to adequately accommodate workforce heterogeneity, significantly reducing their adoption and implementation. To address this gap, we introduce a novel model for the Assembly Line Worker Integration and Balancing Problem considering Multi-skilled Human-Robot Collaboration (ALWIBP-mHRC). This model aims to optimize task scheduling between semi-skilled workers and cobots, aiming to maximize productivity and minimize costs. It features a multi-skilled human-robot collaboration (mHRC) task assignment scheme that selects the optimal assembly/collaboration mode from seven scenarios, based on specific task requirements and resource-skill availability, thus maximizing resource-skill complementarity. To tackle the complexities of this problem, we propose an adaptive multi-objective cooperative co-evolutionary algorithm (a-MOCC) that incorporates a sub-problem decomposition and decoding framework tailored for ALWIBP-mHRC, enhanced by an adaptive evolutionary strategy based on Q-learning (Q-Coevolution). Experimental tests demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method compared to other established metaheuristic algorithms across various instance sizes, underscoring its effectiveness in enhancing the productivity of production systems for semi-skilled workers. The findings are significant for investment decision-making and resource planning, as they highlight the strategic value of integrating cobots in large-scale heterogeneous workforce production.

The main aim of this study is to design, develop test and validate a multi-plant Simulation-Based DT production planning platform for ISCs management. A modular architecture is adopted, and the focus is on a Simulation-Based Digital Twin module, which uses an object-oriented structure and enables what-if analyses, involving several scheduling rules and ISC configurations.

Recent developments in deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based methods for FJSPT have encountered a scale generalization challenge. We propose the Heterogeneous Graph Scheduler (HGS), a novel DRL-based method that provides near-optimal solutions regardless of the scale of operations, machines, and vehicles. HGS modifies the disjunctive graph to model FJSPT as a heterogeneous graph of operations, machines, and vehicles, dynamically representing processes and transportation. It involves a structure-aware heterogeneous graph encoder to enhance scale generalization, using multi-head attention to aggregate messages locally and integrate them globally. A three-stage decoder for end-to-end decision-making outputs the scheduling solution by selecting nodes with the highest likelihood of minimizing makespan. Our evaluation with benchmark datasets shows HGS outperforms traditional dispatching rules, metaheuristics, and existing DRL-based methods, demonstrating superior makespan performance and scale generalization. Moreover, as the scale increases, HGS achieves the best solutions across all instances. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Flexible job-shop scheduling; Reinforcement learning; Scale generalization; Smart manufacturing systems; Transportation constraints","Automatic guided vehicles; Deep reinforcement learning; Flexible manufacturing systems; Job shop scheduling; Reinforcement learning; Flexible job-shop scheduling; Generalisation; Heterogeneous graph; Learning-based methods; Production flexibility; Reinforcement learnings; Scale generalization; Smart manufacturing; Smart manufacturing system; Transportation constraint","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205666227"

This paper presents a mathematical model that jointly optimizes job scheduling, condition-based maintenance planning, and spare parts ordering for deteriorating production systems. The system's degradation state and spare parts inventory state are identified and revealed at the end of the scheduling job. A condition-based maintenance and spare parts ordering policy is triggered based on the captured joint state. Subsequently, we developed a joint optimization model to determine the optimal maintenance thresholds, spare parts ordering thresholds, and job sequences, aimed at minimizing the total weighted expected cost within the scheduling horizon.

The attributes data for various alternatives can be quantitative or qualitative (i.e., expressed in linguistic terms). This paper proposes to transform the qualitative attributes into quantitative attributes by means of simple linear scales rather than complex fuzzy scales. The proposed BHARAT method normalizes the data with reference to the “best” alternative corresponding to an attribute and the normalization procedure is repeated for all the attributes to get the normalized data. A group of decision-makers or a decision-maker assigns ranks to the attributes according to how important they are deemed to be, and these ranks are then transformed into the proper weights. The total scores of the alternatives are calculated by multiplying the weights of the attributes by the corresponding normalized data of the attributes for different alternatives. Four industrial case studies are presented to illustrate the potential of the suggested BHARAT method. The first case study deals with the problem of an automated warehouse selection for a large industrial plant involving a single decision-maker, 13 attributes, and 4 alternative warehouses; the second case study deals with the problem of sustainable maintenance service provider selection for a large petrochemical plant involving fuzzy group decision-making with 5 decision-makers, 9 attributes, and 4 alternative maintenance service providers; the third case study deals with the problem of alternative strategy selection for implementation of a make-to-order system for passenger car manufacturers involving 6 factors, 18 sub-factors, and 3 alternative strategies; and the fourth case study deals with the problem of process parameters selection in a sustainable high speed turning operation involving 4 attributes and 9 alternative sets of experimental conditions.

This method progressively constructs a search tree by gathering samples throughout its execution. Predominantly applied within the realm of gaming, MCTS has exhibited exceptional achievements. Additionally, it has displayed promising outcomes when employed to solve NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems. MCTS has been adapted for distributed-memory parallel platforms. The primary challenges associated with distributed-memory parallel MCTS are the substantial communication overhead and the necessity to balance the computational load among various processes. In this work, we introduce a novel distributed-memory parallel MCTS algorithm with partial backpropagations, referred to as Parallel Partial-Backpropagation MCTS (PPB-MCTS). Our design approach aims to significantly reduce the communication overhead while maintaining, or even slightly improving, the performance in the context of combinatorial optimization problems. To address the communication overhead challenge, we propose a strategy involving transmitting an additional backpropagation message. This strategy avoids attaching an information table to the communication messages exchanged by the processes, thus reducing the communication overhead. Furthermore, this approach contributes to enhancing the decision-making accuracy during the selection phase. The load balancing issue is also effectively addressed by implementing a shared transposition table among the parallel processes. Furthermore, we introduce two primary methods for managing duplicate states within distributed-memory parallel MCTS, drawing upon techniques utilized in addressing duplicate states within sequential MCTS. Duplicate states can transform the conventional search tree into a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). To evaluate the performance of our proposed parallel algorithm, we conduct an extensive series of experiments on solving instances of the Job-Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) and the Weighted Set-Cover Problem (WSCP). These problems are recognized for their complexity and classified as NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems with considerable relevance within industrial applications. The experiments are performed on a cluster of computers with many cores. The empirical results highlight the enhanced scalability of our algorithm compared to that of the existing distributed-memory parallel MCTS algorithms. As the number of processes increases, our algorithm demonstrates increased rollout efficiency while maintaining an improved load balance across processes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Job shop scheduling; Monte Carlo tree search; Parallel algorithms","Combinatorial optimization; Cost reduction; Decision making; Directed graphs; Learning algorithms; Memory architecture; Monte Carlo methods; Parallel algorithms; Scheduling algorithms; Trees (mathematics); Combinatorial optimization problems; Communication overheads; Decisions makings; Distributed Memory; Job-Shop scheduling; Monte carlo tree search; NP-hard; Parallel Monte Carlo; Tree search algorithm; Tree-search; Job shop scheduling","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85197056444"

We first highlight the pros and cons of pure theoretical works by comparing with multiple jop-shop scheduling methods, then emphasize the necessity of considering system resource utilization from perspective of software quality. We then shed light on the definitions of different job-shop scheduling problems and clarify the novel scenario at length with six innate conflicts of WFJSP.

In a real workshop environment, parameters like processing time often change dynamically. Scheduling strategies must be adjusted flexibly and quickly to match the current state. However, traditional methods only find the optimal solution for a specific instance. When environment parameters change, recalculations are required, leading to high time costs. To address these problems, a scheduling method called S2S-AC, based on deep reinforcement learning, is proposed to efficiently solve the dynamic job shop scheduling problem with variable processing times. In the proposed method, JSSP is modeled as a sequential decision-making problem using a Markov Decision Process. A new state set model, including four static states and two dynamic states, is designed with operations as the action set. An end-to-end framework that combines the Pointer Network model with the A2C algorithm is used to construct the DRL network, which is trained with multiple samples. The trained network directly outputs the scheduling strategy for new instances without requiring retraining. In static experiments, the effectiveness of S2S-AC is verified by comparing its solution results with those of SPT, LPT, MTWR, and the genetic algorithm on benchmark instances. In dynamic experiments, S2SAC achieved the best solution results in all randomly generated test instances based on instance ft10, compared to the above methods, with relatively short solution times. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deep reinforcement learning; Dynamic scheduling; Job shop scheduling; Pointer network","Decision making; Deep learning; Job shop scheduling; Markov processes; Reinforcement learning; Scheduling algorithms; Smart manufacturing; Dynamic job shop scheduling; Dynamic scheduling; Intelligent Manufacturing; Job shop scheduling problems; Job-Shop scheduling; Learning-based approach; Pointer network; Reinforcement learnings; Scheduling strategies; Variable processing time; Deep reinforcement learning","Conference paper","Scopus","2-s2.0-85212587515"

However, the availability of big data in Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES) enables training different Machine Learning (ML) models for fast and accurate predictions and decision assessments. Accordingly, this paper proposes an ML-Based Simulation Metamodeling Method (MLBSM) to facilitate DT-based decision-making for dynamic production scheduling in complex Stochastic Flexible Job Shop (SFJS) environments. The proposed MLBSM integrates three modules: a novel data vectorizing method (SPBM), multi-output Adaptive Boosting Regressor (ABR) models, and a new statistical risk evaluation method. SPBM converts unstructured production log data into numerical vectors for ABR training by calculating numeric penalty scores for each job based on the position of operations in the schedule queue. Each trained ABR predicts mean job completion times for various dynamic scenarios based on shift schedules. The risk evaluation method estimates the standard deviation of job completion times and calculates the delay probability scores for each job, aiding DT in promptly evaluating production schedules. Working seamlessly together, MLBSM modules present a novel way of using production log data for ML training and ultimately bypassing several computationally intensive simulation replications. In this research, a simulation model generates the synthetic MES data, focusing on the machining process at a photolithography workstation in the semiconductor manufacturing. Experiments demonstrate the MLBSM's accuracy and efficiency, predicting high-risk jobs with over 80% recall and being at least 70 times faster than conventional simulation runs. Sensitivity analyses also confirm the MLBSM's consistency under different workstation conditions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Digital twin; Machine learning; Metamodeling; Simulation; Smart manufacturing; Stochastic flexible job shop","Flexible manufacturing systems; Job shop scheduling; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Decisions makings; Flexible job shops; Machine-learning; Metamodeling; Metamodeling methods; Simulation; Simulation model; Smart manufacturing; Stochastic flexible job shop; Stochastics","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85201920306"

This type of disruption often creates production chaos and scheduling problems. This paper takes new job insertion and random machine failure as dynamic events. It establishes an optimization model for dynamic flexible job shop scheduling (DFJSP) problems to cope with this issue. A two-stage double deep Q-network, TS-DDQN algorithm is proposed based on an improved deep reinforcement learning algorithm to solve the complex multi-objective DFJSP optimization problem by adopting two-stage decision-making. In the TS-DDQN, an external non-dominated set is used to enhance the training speed of the network and the quality of the solution, which can store the non-dominated solutions. Moreover, the solutions on the Pareto front are used to train the network parameters. Extensive experimentation is conducted on benchmark datasets to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm against the existing scheduling methods. The outcomes underscore the superior efficacy of the proposed algorithm concerning solution quality, convergence speed, and adaptability within dynamic environments.

However, integration of AM technologies within an SC indicates the need to support managers’ decision about such an investment. Therefore, this work develops a Petri net-based decision support model that determines the changes in an SC by adopting AM and improving customer-perceived value (CPV), based on a case study regarding a real-life metal production process. The basis for building such a model is the supply chain operation reference model (SCOR), focusing on CPV, due to the need for redesigning the SC starting from the customer instead of the company. To achieve the research objective, this work introduces a novel verification methodology for a Petri net-based decision model. The research results show that applying the developed model, which is based on the selected characteristics of the production process and parameters describing the potential integration of AM within the SC, allows managers to perceive a scenario in the form of graphical models about positive or negative impacts of introducing AM into the SC.

A special dual-level cooperative self-learning particle swarm optimization (SLPSO) metaheuristic is developed for improved hierarchical decision-making. Adaptive learning is harnessed to guide dynamic job selection under uncertainty, aiming for the highest total value. To minimize tardiness, a neighborhood search operator customizes sequences for each shop, considering changing setup times between jobs. Benchmark tests have been performed, showing that SLPSO surpasses established genetic algorithms and swarm techniques by 8%–15%. When implemented in an operational traditional pharmaceutical manufacturer, significant improvements were observed.

This problem is particularly acute in Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), which are typically labor-intensive environments where operators ""dominate""the production process rather than being subjected to pure automation. In these environments, characterized by high product variability, such as Engineer-To-Order (ETO) or Make-To-Order (MTO) production systems, lead times are usually treated as static data or often outdated, and it is difficult to predict them when a new order arrives in the system. The scientific literature reveals the absence of tools to support SMEs in this planning task and the lack of integration of workforce characteristics and related data in LT prediction methods. To fill these gaps, the main objective of the study is the development of a preliminary theoretical framework for forecasting LT, according to a double planning horizon, which represents the starting point for the development of a decision support system adapted to SME characteristics. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Control; Data Analytics; Digitalization; Human Resources; Intelligent Manufacturing Systems; Lead Time Prediction; Medium Enterprises; Production Planning; Small","Data analytics; Digitalization; Intelligent manufacturing system; Lead time prediction; Leadtime; Media enterprise; Production Planning; Small; Small-and-medium enterprise; Time predictions; Smart manufacturing","Conference paper","Scopus","2-s2.0-85208023240"

This study presents an innovative approach to solving the Flexible Job-Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSP) by integrating Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks based on Relation (HGNNR) with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). The proposed framework models the complex relationships in FJSP using heterogeneous graphs, where operations and machines are represented as nodes, with directed and undirected arcs indicating dependencies and compatibilities. The HGNNR framework comprises four key components: relation-specific subgraph decomposition, data preprocessing, feature extraction through graph convolution, and cross-relation feature fusion using a multi-head attention mechanism. For decision-making, we employ the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, which iteratively updates policies to maximize cumulative rewards through continuous interaction with the environment. Experimental results on four public benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms four state-of-the-art DRL-based techniques and three common rule-based heuristic algorithms, achieving superior scheduling efficiency and generalization capabilities.

Extensive research has been conducted by numerous scholars on the identification of bottleneck machines; however, there is a relative scarcity of research, particularly in the context of flexible manufacturing systems, regarding how to effectively alleviate the identified bottlenecks. In this paper, a novel hyper-heuristic evolutionary scheduling algorithm with a bottleneck alleviation strategy based on the information-energy flow model (HESA-BA-IEF) is proposed for training dispatching rules and optimizing decision-making in flexible job shops with bottleneck machines. HESA-BA-IEF constructs an information-energy flow model for flexible job shops based on complex networks. Through this model, dynamic changes in machine processing status and energy consumption during the scheduling process can be effectively simulated, facilitating the accurate identification of bottleneck machines. Moreover, the algorithm adopts the genetic programming hyper-heuristics and introduces a scheduling mechanism considering the alleviation of bottleneck machines to optimize the makespan and total energy consumption, while simultaneously alleviating bottlenecks. Experiments show that HESA-BA-IEF generates dispatching rules that optimize scheduling and alleviate bottlenecks simultaneously. Furthermore, statistical analysis reveals a 7.71% reduction in bottleneck metrics of production line due to 30.40% scheduling rounds with bottleneck alleviation mechanism in effect. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bottleneck alleviation; Bottleneck identification; Flexible job shop scheduling; Generation hyper-heuristics; Information flow model","Complex networks; Electric load dispatching; Energy utilization; Flexible manufacturing systems; Genetic algorithms; Genetic programming; Heuristic methods; Industrial research; Job shop scheduling; Scheduling algorithms; Bottleneck alleviation; Bottleneck identifications; Bottleneck machines; Decisions makings; Dispatching rules; Energy flow modeling; Flexible job-shop scheduling; Generation hyper-heuristic; Hyper-heuristics; Information flow model; Decision making","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85195057624"

The PPO scheduling agent is trained based on an integration framework of discrete event simulation and deep reinforcement learning. Copies of trained agent can be linked with each machine for distributed control. Meanwhile, state features, actions and rewards are designed for scheduling at each decision point. Reward scaling are applied to improve the convergence performance. The numerical experiments are conducted on cases with different production configurations. The results show that PPO method can realize on-line decision making and provide better solution than dispatch rules and heuristics. It can achieve a balance between time and quality.

The Oven Scheduling Problem (OSP), is an NP-hard real-world parallel batch scheduling problem that arises in the electronic component industry. The goal of the OSP is to schedule jobs on ovens while minimizing total oven operating time, job tardiness, and setup costs. To reduce oven runtime, compatible jobs can be processed simultaneously in batches. The schedule must respect oven eligibility and availability, job release dates, setup times between batches, and oven capacity constraints.We propose and fine-tune a Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) algorithm that uses three different destroy operators and a repair operator based on an exact method (a Constraint Programming model).

Existing studies consider the dynamic arrival of jobs, however, the insertion of urgent jobs such as testing chips poses a challenge to the production model, and there is an urgent need for new scheduling methods to improve the dynamic response and self-adjustment of the shop floor. In this work, deep reinforcement learning is utilized to address the dynamic flexible job shop scheduling problem and facilitate near-real-time shop floor decision-making. We extracted eight state features, including machine utilization, operation completion rate, etc., to reflect real-time shop floor production data. After examining machine availability time, the machine's earliest available time is redefined and incorporated into the design of compound scheduling rules. Eight compound scheduling rules have been developed for job selection and machine allocation.

It poses significant challenges to manufacturing firms and prompts a move from make-to-stock to a more flexible make-to-order system. Compared to make-to-stock settings, make-to-order systems cannot smooth fluctuations in demand using available stock. While viewing dynamic pricing as a useful strategy to balance supply with demand, many manufacturing firms can also create capacity flexibility. In that scenario, system costs could be cut by managing capacity and demand simultaneously. In this paper, we consider a make-to-order production environment with base and surge capacity as well as the ability to adjust product pricing. Our main focus is on operational decision-making, assuming that the base capacity and surge capacity are fixed, but activating the surge capacity incurs a setup cost. Initially, we propose a stochastic control model to reflect this complex decision problem. However, our initial model leads to an intractable dynamic programming problem. To overcome this, we convert the problem to a more tractable diffusion control problem. This approach helps to reveal the conditions under which utilizing flexible capacity is more advantageous than relying solely on fixed capacity. When flexible capacity is advantageous, we provide a solution to the diffusion control problem that can guide optimal capacity and price adjustments. We discover an interesting interplay between capacity adjustment and dynamic pricing. In particular, we find that the price, which aims at reducing congestion, may not monotonically increase with the congestion level when capacity adjustments incur a fixed cost. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","diffusion models; dynamic pricing; flexible capacity; Make-to-order production; queueing","","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200494794"

Addressing the complexities of job shop scheduling problems (JSSP) is essential to improving productivity, reducing costs, and ensuring timely delivery. We propose PetriRL, a novel framework integrating Petri nets and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for JSSP optimization. PetriRL capitalizes on the inherent strengths of Petri nets in modelling discrete event systems while leveraging the advantages of a graph structure. The Petri net governs automated components of the process, ensuring adherence to JSSP constraints. This allows for synergistic collaboration with optimization algorithms such as DRL, particularly in critical decision-making. Unlike traditional methods, PetriRL eliminates the need to preprocess JSSP instances into disjunctive graphs and enhances the explainability of process status through its graphical structure based on places and transitions. Additionally, the inherent graph structure of Petri nets enables the dynamic additions of job operations during the inference phase without requiring agent retraining, thus enhancing flexibility. Experimental results demonstrate PetriRL's robust generalization across various instance sizes and its competitive performance on public test benchmarks and randomly generated instances.

Consequently, it becomes imperative for robots to execute in a safe and adaptive manner rather than solely relying on pre-programmed instructions. To tackle it, a systematic solution for safe robot motion generation in human–robot collaborative activities is proposed, leveraging mixed-reality technologies and Deep Reinforcement Learning.

However, the sequencing flexibility with discrete and hybrid operation constraints are also widely existed in the actual production and have significant impact on production efficiency. Therefore, this work proposes a distributed flexible job shop scheduling problem considering integrated sequencing flexibility (DFJSPS), in which the serial, discrete and hybrid operation constraints are considered simultaneously. A mixed integer linear programming model is proposed to solve the DFJSPS by using the CPLEX solver. Then, an efficient memetic algorithm (EMA) is designed with the objectives of minimizing makespan and total energy consumption. In the EMA, a five-layer coding method and an efficient initialization method are presented to obtain high quality initial solutions; and an efficient local search operator is designed to help the algorithm to improve its convergence speed. Comprehensive experiments show that the EMA outperforms other three well-known algorithms in most of the instances, demonstrating the superior performance of EMA for solving DFJSPS in terms of both computational efficiency and solution quality. In summary, the research fills the research gap on integrated sequencing flexibility in the field of shop floor scheduling; on the other hand, it can help production managers to obtain the efficient scheduling schemas in the decision-making systems about various types of sequencing flexibility. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Distributed flexible job shop scheduling; Memetic algorithm; Operation constraint; Sequencing flexibility","Decision making; Energy utilization; Integer programming; Job shop scheduling; Production efficiency; Scheduling algorithms; Distributed flexible job shop scheduling; Flexible job-shop scheduling; Flexible job-shop scheduling problem; Hybrid operations; Memetic algorithms; Mixed integer linear programming model; Operation constraint; Sequencing flexibility; Shopfloors; Computational efficiency","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85179121383"

In the industrial network, each connection between two individual stations has limited communication bandwidth, while each station has limited computing and storage capability and is only accessible to its local information. The resource packages flowing within the industrial network are treated as agents that have different sizes and different levels of decision-making priority. This makes the industrial resource scheduling problem on the industrial network a multi-level decision-making problem with information asymmetry. Specifically, the resource packages with lower decision-making priority have knowledge of the decisions made by those with higher priority, but not vice versa. To solve this resource scheduling problem with information asymmetry, an SgHQN model is developed by exploiting partial observations. It is found that the proposed SgHQN can be used to solve resource scheduling problems for general industrial networks.

FaaS aims to optimize feeding systems in cloud manufacturing environments to meet the demands of mass customization and allow for quick responses to production changes. Therefore, it fits into the Manufacturing-as-a-Service (MaaS) system as well. As the manufacturing industry undergoes significant transformations through automation and service-oriented models, understanding how FaaS fits into the other frameworks is essential. This study presents a systematic literature review with two primary objectives: first, to contextualize FaaS within AaaS and MaaS, highlighting similarities, differences, and distinctive characteristics; second, to identify and clarify the essential Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) crucial for its strategic implementation. KPIs are pivotal metrics guiding organizations toward manufacturing excellence. In this context, common KPIs focus on efficiency and quality, such as resource utilization, and error rates. Other KPIs are also crucial, such as the ones related to cost reduction and customer satisfaction. For FaaS, the most relevant include also data security, data management, and network speed. This research provides a valuable KPI framework for FaaS developers, aiding in strategic decision-making and deployment in industrial settings. It also contributes to a broader understanding of KPIs in manufacturing, which benefits both researchers and industrial practitioners. The results of the review, though, fail to address other crucial indicators for ‘as-a-Service’ business, such as Churn Rate and Total Contract Value.

In demand-driven personalized production modes, achieving a balance between workshop resources and the diverse demands of customers presents a challenge in scheduling. Additionally, considering the self-interested behaviors of agents, this study focuses on tackling the problem of multi-agent job shop scheduling with private information. Multiple consumer agents and one job shop agent are considered, all of which are self-interested and have private information. To address this problem, a two-stage decentralized algorithm rooted in the genetic algorithm is developed to achieve a consensus schedule. The algorithm allows agents to evolve independently and concurrently, aiming to satisfy individual requirements. To prevent becoming trapped in a local optimum, the search space is broadened through crossover between agents and agent-based block insertion. Non-dominated sorting and grey relational analysis are applied to generate the final solution with high social welfare. The proposed algorithm is compared using a centralized approach and two state-of-the-art decentralized approaches in computational experiments involving 734 problem instances. The results validate that the proposed algorithm generates non-dominated solutions with strong convergence and uniformity. Moreover, the final solution produced by the developed algorithm outperforms those of the decentralized approaches.

The decision maker must consider several important factors while forming the production schedule, including job-assembly line compatibility, the release times and due dates of the jobs, and a workload balance among the different assembly lines. This study aims to develop an algorithm to minimize the total earliness and tardiness while considering sequence-and-machine-dependent setups, unequal release times, machine-job compatibility restrictions, and workload balance requirements.

Numerous variables, such as equipment wear and tear, the service level of the supply chain, etc., may have a significant impact on the efficiency of high-end equipment manufacturing. In this paper, motivated by the need to improve the productivity of engines, we study a scheduling problem considering the deterioration effect, component parts supply, and parallel serial-batch processing machines. The job processing time is sum-of-actual-processing-time-dependent and the set-up time of a batch is time-dependent. The objective is to minimize the makespan. Firstly, we analyze the structural properties of the problem under two special cases. Then, a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm is proposed to group the jobs into batches, and two heuristic algorithms are designed to improve the job sequence based on the structural properties. Algorithm 3 is proposed to provide a lower bound for the investigated problem. Next, we develop a variable neighborhood search algorithm (VNS-H) which integrates the DP algorithm, heuristic algorithms, and four local search strategies. Extensive computational experiments are conducted to validate the performance of the proposed algorithm. The results show that the VNS-H algorithm solves the proposed problem effectively and outperforms other involved metaheuristics.

This paper proposes an end-to-end Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) method to make the two decisions simultaneously. To capture the problem characteristics and realize the objective optimization, the Markov Decision Process (MDP) of DJSP is formulated. Specialised action space made up of operation-factory pairs is designed to achieve the simultaneous decision-making. A stitched disjunctive graph representation of DJSP is specially designed, and a Graph Neural Network (GNN) based feature extraction architecture is proposed to dig the state embedding during problem solving.

In such a unique and complex scenario as the real job shop, the modelling of SMS as a Markov decision process (MDP), and its approach by deep reinforcement learning (DRL), is a research field of growing interest given its characteristics. It allows us to consider achieving high flexibility levels by promoting process automation, autonomy in decision making, and the ability to act in real time when faced with disturbances and disruptions in a highly dynamic environment. This paper addresses the problem of scheduling a quasi-realistic job shop environment characterised by machines receiving jobs from buffers that accumulate numerous jobs using a wide variety of parts and multimachine routes with a diverse number of operation phases by developing a digital twin of the job shop based on a MDP with the DRL methodology. This is approached by: modelling the job shop scheduling environment with OpenAI Gym; designing an observation space with 18 job features; designing an action space composed of three priority heuristic rules; shaping a single reward function with a multi-objective characteristic; using the implementation of the proximal policy optimisation (PPO) algorithm from the Stable Baselines 3 library. This modelling approach, dubbed as job shop smart manufacturing scheduling (JS-SMS), is characterised by deterministic formulation and implementation. The model is subjected to validation by comparing it to several of the best-known heuristic priority rules. The main findings of this methodology allow to replicate, to a great extent, the positive aspects of heuristic rules and to mitigate the negative ones, which achieves more balanced behaviour in most of the measures established as performance indicators and outperforms heuristic rules from this multi-objective perspective.

This paper investigates a distributed assembly job shop scheduling problem (DAJSP) which consists of two production phases. The first stage processes components in several job shops, and the second stage assembles the processed parts into final products. First, a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is established to describe the problem with minimizing maximum completion time and find optimal schedules for small-scale scenarios. Afterwards, a genetic algorithm with variable neighborhood search (GA-VNS) is proposed to address more complex instances, which adopts the genetic algorithm as the main framework and employs the variable neighborhood search for exploration. A problem-specific three-vector encoding scheme is designed to represent three decision-making processes of the DAJSP accordingly. To improve candidate solutions, a disjunctive graph model for DAJSP is formulated and three critical path-based neighborhood structures which directly perform on encoding vectors are designed. Numerical experiments are conducted on four groups of instances with different scales and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MILP model and GA-VNS. To sum up, the proposed GA-VNS shows the best performance on 30 instances out of 40 instances, while the superior stability has also been proved by statistical tests.

Traditional quality control methods are often inadequate when faced with complex production data and changing manufacturing environments. Therefore, exploring new intelligent quality control technologies to cope with these challenges in intelligent manufacturing has become an important research direction. In view of this, the study proposed a quality control technology that combines association rules and fuzzy decision-making. Firstly, association rule mining methods are used to analyze production data and extract the relationships between key quality factors. Secondly, based on these association rules, fuzzy decision technology is used to adjust and optimize the production process, ultimately achieving quality control of products in the intelligent manufacturing production process. The data showed that when running on the training set and validation set, the research method reached a stable state at 18 and 46 iterations of the system, respectively, with a minimum cost loss function value. In both batch production lines, the detection efficiency under the operation of the research method remained at 2200 units per minute. During the process of repeating the system for 6 times, the research method consistently achieved maximum control accuracy and minimum time consumption. The satisfaction of the four experts with the operation of the research method in small batch production and large batch production was 9.32 and 9.2, respectively, significantly higher than other algorithms. The above results indicated that the proposed method can effectively improve the efficiency of product quality control, reduce production costs, and ultimately reduce the rate of defective products in the production process. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Association rules; Fuzzy decision-making; Intelligent manufacturing; Production; Quality control","Association rules; Decision making; Industrial research; Production efficiency; Quality assurance; Batch production; Control technologies; Decision quality; Fuzzy decision; Fuzzy Decision making; Intelligent Manufacturing; Manufacturing efficiency; Production data; Production process; Research method; Quality control","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182912990"

In the FJSP, a set of jobs, comprising multiple operations, must be allocated to a predefined set of machines, each with its respective execution times. The distribution of operations across machines significantly impacts scheduling efficiency, which can be evaluated and optimized based on various performance criteria and objectives. To address this complex problem, a multi-objective optimization algorithm is employed, focusing on three main performance criteria: completion time of all operations (Makespan), load assigned to the most heavily utilized machine, and the sum of loads across all machines. An FJSP algorithm based on the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) metaheuristic (FJSP. ABC) generates a Pareto set comprising non-dominated and dominated solutions. These solutions represent optimal or near-optimal production schedules and offer diverse representations, such as Gantt charts. However, the decision-making process for selecting the best production schedule from the Pareto set demands additional considerations. To this end, we propose adopting a decision-making (DM) algorithm based on Fuzzy TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution in a Fuzzy environment). The DM Fuzzy TOPSIS algorithm accommodates the inclusion of variables not covered by the FJSP algorithm and aids decision-makers in identifying the most suitable production schedule based on the specific requirements of the production system. These additional variables may include maximizing or minimizing machine idleness, balancing the load of operations on machines, etc. Experimental results demonstrate that the application of the proposed algorithm yields values close to the expected outcomes for the analyzed variables proposed. The DM Fuzzy TOPSIS algorithm proves to be a valuable tool for supporting decision-making in production systems, assisting in the selection of the best production schedule among the optimal or near-optimal solutions obtained from the Pareto set. By integrating multi-objective optimization and decision-making techniques, this research contributes to more efficient and informed production scheduling practices, ultimately enhancing overall system performance. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial bee colony; Decision maker; FJSP; Fuzzy TOPSIS; Multiobjective optimization; Pareto frontier","Balancing; Decision making; Job shop scheduling; Production control; Artificial bee colony; Artificial bees; Decision makers; Decisions makings; Flexible job-shop scheduling problem; fuzzy-TOPSIS; Multi-objectives optimization; Pareto frontiers; Pareto set; Production schedule; Multiobjective optimization","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85178026266"

In FJSP, operations can be processed on multiple machines, leading to intricate relationships between operations and machines. Recent works have employed deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to learn priority dispatching rules (PDRs) for solving FJSP. However, the quality of solutions still has room for improvement relative to that by the exact methods such as OR-Tools. To address this issue, this article presents a novel end-to-end learning framework that weds the merits of self-attention models for deep feature extraction and DRL for scalable decision-making. The complex relationships between operations and machines are represented precisely and concisely, for which a dual-attention network (DAN) comprising several interconnected operation message attention blocks and machine message attention blocks is proposed. The DAN exploits the complicated relationships to construct production-adaptive operation and machine features to support high-quality decision-making. Experimental results using synthetic data as well as public benchmarks corroborate that the proposed approach outperforms both traditional PDRs and the state-of-the-art DRL method.

Especially when coupled with preventive maintenance (PM) scheduling for massive distributed machines, most current methods fail to promise agility and effectiveness simultaneously under this service-oriented paradigm. Therefore, this article aims to propose a collaborative scheduling algorithm to support real-time production and opportunistic maintenance (OM) in the highly dynamic CMfg environment. First, a novel collaborative scheduling model that combines real-time production and PM decision-making is formulated. Then, to address significant complexity in production scheduling, a dynamic suborder-oriented scheduling (DSS) strategy is designed to utilize frequent triggered events for allocating optimal manufacturing services in real time. Then, for improving computational capability in PM decision-making, a production-driven PM policy with two stage adjustment (TSA) is developed to adopt suborder changeovers as PM opportunities to formulate group PM decisions for massive machines. Finally, a collaborative DSS-TSA algorithm is designed to cyclically coordinate the real-time production scheduling with OM decision-making to avoid repetitively solving large-scale joint problems. Our collaborative scheduling algorithm is verified in a real CMfg scenario for gas turbine blades.

This study investigates the potential of DDS for resource allocation (RA) in high-mix, low-volume smart manufacturing systems with mixed automation levels. A DDS-based decision support system (DDS-DSS) is developed by incorporating two RA strategies: simulation-based bottleneck analysis (SB-BA) and simulation-based multi-objective optimization (SB-MOO). To enhance the performance of SB-MOO, a unique meta-learning mechanism featuring memory, dynamic orthogonal array, and learning rate is integrated into the NSGA-II, resulting in a modified version of the NSGA-II with meta-learning (i.e., NSGA-II-ML). The proposed DSS also benefits from a post-optimality analysis that leverages a clustering algorithm to derive actionable insights. A real-life marine engine manufacturing application study is presented to demonstrate the applicability and exhibit efficacy of the proposed DSS and NSGA-II-ML. To this aim, NSGA-II-ML was tested against the original NSGA-II and differential evolution (DE) algorithm across a set of test problems. The results revealed that NSGA-II-ML surpassed the other two in terms of the number of non-dominated solutions and hypervolume, particularly in medium and large-sized problems. Furthermore, NSGA-II-ML achieved a 24% improvement in the best throughput found in the real case problem, outperforming SB-BA, NSGA-II, and DE.

Meanwhile, the development in manufacturing intelligence and informatization allows for storing a vast amount of scheduling data during production. Consequently, a novel approach emerges in constructing scheduling models and decision-making strategies based on historical data. Following this idea, this paper proposes a dual-driven dynamic scheduling approach for complex flexible manufacturing job shops, utilizing a combination of manually designed DRs and backpropagation neural network (BPNN) technology. Specifically, six different production scenarios are designed to optimize different objectives, simulating the actual complex manufacturing environment. Then, a real-time scheduling mapping network model is developed with the production states as input and selected DRs as output by training the BPNN. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed method in resolving dynamic scheduling issues of complex flexible manufacturing job shops, surpassing traditional manual DRs. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","complex flexible manufacturing job shop; dispatching rules; dynamic scheduling; neural network","Machine shops; Smart manufacturing; Back-propagation neural networks; Complex flexible manufacturing job shop; Dispatching rules; Dynamic scheduling; Flexible manufacturing; Informatization; Job-shop; Manufacturing jobs; Neural-networks; Production environments; Flexible manufacturing systems","Conference paper","Scopus","2-s2.0-85217079892"

Design/methodology/approach: We adopted an action research (AR) approach to analyze the potential consequences of implementing Heijunka in a factory that faces demand that is not very predictable, and customers who require ever more individualized products at low prices with extremely demanding delivery times. An estimation of costs was carried out to compare three alternative production planning scenarios: (1) make to order (MTO) production, (2) weekly levelled production, and (3) production with minimal changeovers. Findings: The analysis of the impact of implementing Heijunka in this factory demonstrated that MTO production planning without Heijunka is the most suitable option for the factory, bearing in mind that requested delivery times are the priority. We explore why Heijunka is unsuitable for this factory even though other lean principles and tools have been successfully implemented. In this way, we identify the main factors that might influence the successful implementation of Heijunka, such as changeover time, the number of different product types (and lot sizes), and the production lines’ capacity. Originality/value: Based on close collaboration between researchers and practitioners in the field of Operations Management, this AR study provides important information for decision-making regarding the application of Heijunka, and for advancing the current academic debate about successful lean transformation. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","action research; case study; costs estimates; Heijunka; lean management; make to order","","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85211760901"

Unsurprisingly, technology providers and integrators are increasingly assisting in optimising production efficiency by implementing industrial robots and the necessary end-effectors into production lines. However, still too often in today's robotic applications, dedicated grippers are designed to perform single tasks therewith adversely increasing cycle times and robot cell spaces due to constantly switching grippers from a tool magazine. In order to reduce handling costs and to cope with mass customisation, versatile grasping of various objects with multi-purpose grippers is key in evolving to modular assembly systems. Nowadays, thoughtful selection and design of robotic grippers is still mainly restricted to expert knowledge due its ad hoc and multi-objective nature. However, gripper selection and design should be tailored to the properties of the objects to be grasped, and the tasks to be executed. As a result, current solutions often end up being partly appropriate and/or over-dimensioned. The use of software tools to support this complex decision-making process is needed but limited so far. This paper presents a user-friendly toolkit that assists in selecting appropriate robotic grippers for grasping pre-specified ranges of objects. For this, a web API has been established for accessing the available gripper database and selection methodology. Additionally, this toolkit assists in designing multi-functional jaws for impactive grippers, and lay-outing individually positioned astrictive grippers. The underlying optimiser will try to find the most ideal grasping points on each object in accordance with quality metrics and constraints, and this for each of the selected grippers. To demonstrate the functionality of the presented toolkit, two case studies on impactive and astrictive gripper designs have been worked out involving 3D mechatronic and 2D sheet metal parts. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","grasp optimisation; gripper design; gripper selection; mass customization; multi-purpose grippers","Industrial robots; Modular robots; Grasp optimization; Gripper designs; Gripper selection; Mass customization; Modular robotics; Multi-purpose; Multi-purpose gripper; Robotic grippers; Robotic systems; User friendly; Grippers","Conference paper","Scopus","2-s2.0-85204084969"

Increased job shop flexibility has only added to the difficulty of scheduling operations. Partial flexible job shop scheduling is one in which a job operation can only be performed on one of a predefined subset of alternative machines. Priority dispatching rules (PDRs) are used to decide the order in which operations in the queue should be selected. In this study, a novel procedure has been devised to prioritise jobs in a partial flexible job shop. Entropy method has been used in this study for determining the weights for the conflicting criteria, and the VIKOR method is used to determine the priority of jobs. Discrete event simulation models are developed to evaluate the performance measures, namely makespan, flow time, and tardiness. Well-known benchmark instances and a large-scale real-world problem have been utilised to evaluate the performance of the proposed method.

FJSPLS couples three important sub-problems: operation sequencing, machine selection, and lot splitting. Deep reinforcement learning(DRL) methods have not been applied to this research area. This paper presents an innovative method using DRL with graph neural network (GNN) to solve FJSPLS with equal and consistent sub-lots. First, to facilitate integrated decision-making for the sub-problems, two distinct agents with independent parameters are developed. One agent is designated to handle the integrated decisions concerning operations arrangement and machine allocation, while the other focuses on overseeing decisions regarding lot-splitting for job orders. Second, to enhance the capabilities of each agent in extracting features from environmental observations, an enhanced disjunctive graph (EDG) and heterogeneous graph feature extractor(HGFE) have been constructed.

To this end, the paper proposes a reinforcement learning framework with multiple decision-making actions (multi-action) based on multi-Pointer Graph Neural Network (multi-PGN) to meet the challenges of FJSP-RT. First, in order to efficiently express the environmental state of FJSP-RT, a heterogeneous disjunction graph is constructed, and a Heterogeneous Graph-based Multi-Model Network (HGMN) is used as the embedding representation method of the graph. Second, based on the multi-action decision-making process of FJSP-RT, multi-PGN is used to obtain and analyze effective information in heterogeneous graph to make high-quality scheduling decisions. In addition, the proposed multi-PGN is implemented using a new Proximal Policy Optimization that extends a single action to multiple actions, called multi-PPO. Through extensive experiments on instances, the research results show that this method has superior performance compared to traditional hand-designed scheduling rules.

However, less attention has been paid to the mass customization of conspicuous products, which could lead to unsuitable product decisions and pricing strategy, and then bring financial risks to the brand. Different from mainstream products, consumers of conspicuous products care not only about product quality, but also about its added value. Based on the conspicuous consumption behavior of consumers (exclusivity and conformity), this paper proposes a Hotelling model of conspicuous products’ mass customization using a rational expectation framework, and investigate different mass customization strategies in both monopoly and duopoly markets. The results show that the increase of conformity reduces the pricing of both the standard and mass-customized products, while the increase of exclusivity raises the pricing of the both products. By comparing equilibrium results in different market environments, we also find whether the mass customization strategy is profitable is related to product cost. This paper reveals how the introduction of mass customization affects brand decision-making in monopolistic and duopolistic markets and analyzes the importance of considering consumers’ conspicuous consumption behavior in pricing. The findings provide a theoretical basis and practical guidance for conspicuous brands to develop more suitable mass customization strategies. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","conspicuous consumption; game theory; mass customization; pricing","Commerce; Competition; Computer aided manufacturing; Consumer behavior; Decision making; Game theory; Added values; Conspicuous consumption; Customization services; Customization strategies; Decision strategy; Financial risks; Game theoretical analysis; Mass customization; Pricing strategy; Products quality; Costs","Conference paper","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200341219"

Although it is possible to improve efficiency by applying new and more efficient machines, decision makers tend to look for less expensive alternatives. Furthermore, the current reality of manufacturing companies, brought about by Industry 4.0, requires more flexibility of production systems and increase the complexity off machine rescheduling without compromising sustainable requirements. This study contributes to the subject by applying machine learning techniques in a job shop to reduce the makespan and estimate the total energy consumption. First, an artificial neural network (ANN) was trained to estimate the total electrical energy consumption in the system. A new input variable for the network was defined to assist in energy estimation. This variable is called the Priority Factor (PF) and helps capture the different patterns in the job shop. Second, as the ANN was trained, a Genetic Algorithm (GA) was used to reduce the makespan. Therefore, it is possible to reduce the makespan and know in advance the total electricity consumption in production.

The facility manufactures over 2,000 variants of Top Notch products, primarily custom made-to-order products, in a high mix, low volume environment. The resulting long lead times have led to late deliveries and the loss of potential new customers. Kennametal is interested in identifying and addressing the root problems causing long lead times. Prior to this project, data analysis of individual work center lead times and scrap rates was entirely manual. Besides requiring excessive time and effort, the process often produced outdated or inaccurate results - affecting their ability to identify opportunities for improvement. The primary focus of the project is to increase manufacturing process data accuracy, visibility, and real-time analysis. The proposed solution is a dashboard that provides a clear and accurate picture of the current state of their system. Kennametal is prioritizing reducing lead times, scrap rates, and increasing on-time performance, but prior to the dashboard tool, tracking progress toward those objectives and identifying solutions to address the issues were ineffective. Phase 1 of the project included data analysis, product grouping, and visualizations. The team developed a Python script to do the initial analysis of the data due to the complexity of the constraints on the calculations. Next, five distinct product groups within the Top Notch product family were defined. Finally, the calculations were adapted to natively run within Power BI to generate a dashboard with the desired metrics for each product group. Phase 2 focused on solution implementation and dashboard verification. Based on Phase 1 metrics, the team worked with Kennametal to implement several solutions to address lead time. The most impactful initial solution implemented was a standardization that increased the percentage of products manufactured from Blanks from 35.5% to 72%. This reduces the lead time by an average of 12 days per converted product. The final part of Phase 2 was to measure the impacts of the implemented solutions to validate the efficacy of using the dashboard metrics to inform decision-making. As a result of implementations to date, the weighted average of lead times reduced from 82.62 days to 63.86 days. Notably, the lead time for the product family, High Velocity from Blanks, decreased from 64.44 days to 28.52 days. The overall weighted average scrap rate decreased from 34.51% to 23.53%. On-time performance for the Top Notch product line increased from 61.46% to 70.61% overall. The overall results in lead time reduction, scrap reduction, and the on-time performance increase validate the effectiveness of utilizing the dashboard to inform decision-making in the manufacturing of Top Notch products within Kennametal's Nashville facility. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dashboard; Data Analytics; Process Improvement; Standardization","Data Analytics; Data handling; Decision making; Information analysis; Python; Visualization; Dashboard; Data analytics; Leadtime; Long-lead time; On-time performance; Phase 1; Process Improvement; Product groups; Productline; Scrap rate; Standardization","Conference paper","Scopus","2-s2.0-85195270622"

RTMN combines process modeling and robot execution. Intuitive robot programming allows those without programming expertise to plan and control robots through easily understandable predefined modeling notations. These notations achieve no-code programming and serve as templates for users to create their processes via drag-and-drop functions with graphical representations. The design of the graphical user interface is based on a user survey and gaps identified in the literature We validate our survey through the most influential technology acceptance models, with two major factors: the perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness. While RTMN focuses on the ease of use and flexibility of robot programming by providing an intuitive modeling language, RTMN 2.0 concentrates on human–robot collaboration (HRC), which represents the current trend of the industry shift from “mass-production” to “mass-customization”. The biggest contribution that RTMN 2.0 makes is the creation of synergy between HRC modes (based on ISO standards) and HRC task types in the literature. They are modeled as five different HRC task notations: Coexistence Fence, Sequential Cooperation SMS, Teaching HG, Parallel Cooperation SSM, and Collaboration PFL. Both collaboration and safety criteria are defined for each notation. While traditional isolated robot systems in “mass-production” environments provide high payload capabilities and repeatability, they suffer from limited flexibility and dexterity in order to be adapted to the variability of customized products. Therefore, human–robot collaboration is a suitable arrangement to leverage the unique capabilities of both humans and robots for increased efficiency and quality in the new “mass-customization” industrial environments. HRC has made a great impact on the robotic industry: it leads to increased efficiency, reduced costs, and improved productivity, which can be adopted to make up for the skill gap of a shortage of workers in the manufacturing industry. The extension of RTMN 2.0 includes the following notations: HRC tasks, requirements, Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), condition checks and decision making, join/split, and data association. With these additional elements, RTMN 2.0 meets the full range of criteria for agile manufacturing—light-out manufacturing is a manufacturing philosophy that does not rely on human labor. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","decision making; HRC; HRC mode; HRC task; KPI; requirement; RTMN","","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85192441999"

In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved success in solving sequence decision-making problems. However, the efficiency of the generated scheduling plans is often constrained by the dependence of most DRL algorithms on priority dispatching rules (PDR). In order to enable the agent trained in DRL to autonomously choose operations and machines, this paper proposes an expert-guided deep reinforcement learning framework (EGDRL). Based on the representation of scheduling states using a disjunctive graph and an operation-machine topology graph, a graph neural network (GNN) is used to capture the complex relationships between operations and machines. More importantly, in the early stages of training, this paper introduces expert-guided solutions by using PDR to guide the action selection of reinforcement learning, which greatly improves the quality of decision-making. Experimental results consistently show that the proposed method outperforms traditional PDRs and other DRL algorithm. Notably, this superiority is observed across various scales, including larger instances. Additionally, the method exhibits robust performance on instances not encountered during training. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deep reinforcement learning; Expert-guided; Flexible job shop scheduling; Graph neural network; Priority dispatching rules","Autonomous agents; Decision making; Deep learning; Efficiency; Graph neural networks; Job shop scheduling; Topology; Automated productions; Decision-making problem; Deep reinforcement learning; Expert-guided; Flexible job-shop scheduling; Flexible job-shop scheduling problem; Priority dispatching rules; Reinforcement learning algorithms; Reinforcement learnings; Reinforcement learning","Conference paper","Scopus","2-s2.0-85192182500"

The Harris hawk optimization (HHO) algorithm, as a typical metaheuristic algorithm, has been widely employed to solve scheduling problems. However, HHO suffers from premature convergence when solving NP-hard problems. Therefore, this paper proposes an improved HHO algorithm (GNHHO) to solve the FJSP. GNHHO introduces an elitism strategy, a chaotic mechanism, a nonlinear escaping energy update strategy, and a Gaussian random walk strategy to prevent premature convergence. A flexible job shop scheduling model is constructed, and the static and dynamic FJSP is investigated to minimize the makespan. This paper chooses a two-segment encoding mode based on the job and the machine of the FJSP. To verify the effectiveness of GNHHO, this study tests it in 23 benchmark functions, 10 standard job shop scheduling problems (JSPs), and 5 standard FJSPs. Besides, this study collects data from an agricultural company and uses the GNHHO algorithm to optimize the company’s FJSP. The optimized scheduling scheme demonstrates significant improvements in makespan, with an advancement of 28.16% for static scheduling and 35.63% for dynamic scheduling. Moreover, it achieves an average increase of 21.50% in the on-time order delivery rate. The results demonstrate that the performance of the GNHHO algorithm in solving FJSP is superior to some existing algorithms. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Flexible job shop scheduling; improved Harris hawk optimization algorithm (GNHHO); maximum completion time (makespan); premature convergence","Computational complexity; Job shop scheduling; Completion time; Decision-making problem; Flexible job-shop scheduling; Flexible job-shop scheduling problem; Improved harris hawk optimization algorithm (GNHHO); Intelligent Manufacturing; Makespan; Maximum completion time (makespan); Optimization algorithms; Premature convergence; Decision making","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189331830"

The problem is very complex, and solutions are often needed fast. Although many solution methods have been proposed, with increasingly better results, their computational times are not suitable for decision-makers who want solutions instantly. Therefore, we propose a novel greedy heuristic to efficiently generate production plans and schedules of good quality. The main innovation of our approach represents the incorporation of a simulation-based technique, which directly generates schedules while simultaneously determining lot sizes. By utilising priority rules, this unique feature enables us to address the complexity of job shop scheduling environments and ensures the feasibility of the resulting schedules. Using a selection of well-known rules from the literature, experiments on a variety of shop configurations and complexities showed that the proposed heuristic is able to obtain solutions with an average gap to Cplex of 4.12%.

The lot-streaming technique divides the products into several lots. The production scheduling determines the processing order of products. This paper focuses on the integration of lot sizing and scheduling problem in the distributed heterogeneous hybrid flow shop (DHHFSLSP) which considers determining the quantity and size of lots, factory assignment, machine selection, and order sequence. A learning-driven iterated local search algorithm (LDILS) is proposed for solving the DHHFSLP. Firstly, a framework of learning-driven trajectory-based meta-heuristics is proposed, where a learning engine is integrated to guide the state of searching. Then, an NEH-based constructive heuristic is proposed to generate a promising initial solution. Next, several lot sizing and scheduling searching operators are proposed. Based on these operators, Q-learning is regarded as a learning engine to capture the searching state and choose a searching action. Finally, a restart mechanism is used to calibrate searching direction by copying the best solution found so far. A comprehensive experiment based on amounts of testing instances is conducted to investigate the effectiveness of initialization, Q-learning framework, and searching operators. Compared to relevant algorithms, LDILS can solve the DHHFSLSP effectively and efficiently. Note to Practitioners - This paper studies a lot sizing and scheduling problem in the distributed heterogeneous hybrid flow shop, which are always faced by planners and production managers. The reasonable lot sizing plans and schedules can increase the efficiency of production. The model of this paper can be used in many real productions when meeting the following conditions, i.e. heterogeneous factories, flow shops, and parallel machines, and the jobs can be split into several sub-lots. This paper proposes a learning-driven iterated local search algorithm, which can obtain high-quality solutions for decision-makers. The experiment results demonstrate its high effectiveness and efficiency. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","distributed hybrid flow shop; iterated local search; Lot sizing; Q-learning; scheduling","Decision making; Efficiency; Engines; Learning algorithms; Local search (optimization); Machine shop practice; Production control; DH-HEMTs; Distributed hybrid flow shop; Hybrid flow shop; Iterated local search; Job-Shop scheduling; Lot sizing; Production facility; Q-learning; Schedule; Search problem; Job shop scheduling","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85181576833"

Parallel machine scheduling (PMS) is a critical aspect of production planning that directly impacts resource utilization and operational efficiency. In this paper, we investigate the application of metaheuristic optimization algorithms to address the unrelated parallel machine scheduling problem (UPMSP) through the lens of sustainable development goals (SDGs). The primary objective of this study is to explore how metaheuristic optimization algorithms can contribute to achieving sustainable development goals in the context of UPMSP. We examine a range of metaheuristic algorithms, including genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization, ant colony optimization, and more, and assess their effectiveness in optimizing the scheduling problem at hand. The evaluation of the algorithms focuses on their ability to improve the optimization of job-to-machine assignments, enabling industries to efficiently minimize the overall makespan of scheduling tasks. This, in turn, leads to waste reduction and enhanced energy efficiency. To conduct a comprehensive analysis, we consider UPMSP instances that incorporate sustainability-related constraints and objectives. We assess the algorithms' performance in terms of solution quality, convergence speed, robustness, and scalability, while also examining their implications for sustainable resource allocation and environmental stewardship. The findings of this study provide insights into the efficacy of metaheuristic optimization algorithms for addressing UPMSP with a focus on sustainable development goals. By leveraging these algorithms, industries can optimize scheduling decisions to minimize waste and enhance energy efficiency. The practical implications of this research are valuable for decision-makers, production planners, and researchers seeking to achieve sustainable development goals in the context of unrelated parallel machine scheduling.

Facing the tendency of mass customization, distributed workshops are required to have the reconfiguration capability to produce multiple products. Based on the scheduling demands of distributed workshops, this paper studied the dynamic distributed reconfigurable flowshop scheduling problem (DRFSP) with new job arrivals using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for the first time. The DRL-based intelligent scheduling and reconfiguration systems are modeled by designing efficient rewards, actions, and state features for both scheduling and reconfiguration agents. A new state feature normalization approach is proposed to address the variability in production configurations and dynamics. A novel expected deep Q-network (EDQN) algorithm is proposed to provide more precise state-action values rather than using estimations. Moreover, the DRL-based training and execution procedures for the dynamic DRFSP are provided by combining decision-making, agent learning, and reconfigurable production. Training curves validate the reasonableness of system modeling and the good learning efficiency of the EDQN algorithm. Extensive comparison experiments show that our EDQN algorithm outperforms three popular DRL algorithms and four well-known priority dispatching rules (PDRs) by around 20 % and 89 % respectively, with good generalization ability and time efficiency.

Previous studies attempted to deal with this issue by simplifying this problem due to the degradation uncertainties of the machines, ignoring the substantial interactions between these two tasks and leading to less efficiency of the entire production system. In this study, we fill the gap and formulate the joint optimization problem with more emphasis on the interaction between job scheduling and maintenance for a series-parallel multistage production system. Specifically, a mixed-effect degradation model is proposed to leverage the underlying interaction between job scheduling and machine maintenance. To efficiently solve this joint problem, several properties from this formulation have been derived. A two-phase method considering condition-based information, with a proactive algorithm for local intensification and a condition-based workload reallocation strategy & maintenance strategy, is then developed to address the uncertainties from the machine degradation status. A numerical study is finally borrowed to demonstrate the higher production efficiency achieved by applying the proposed method, compared with other benchmarks. Note to Practitioners-This study is motivated by a practical scenario where both job allocation and maintenance need to be determined simultaneously in the multistage production system by the operators to achieve time and cost efficiency. We focus on developing a new scheme that job scheduling and machine maintenance are able to be conducted simultaneously. Two issues are noteworthy to better implement this scheme. First, for characterizing the interaction between scheduling and maintenance, the data collected in real-time can provide a sufficient basis for the degradation path, and the production parameters can be acquired from real practice. Second, this scheme can be offered to help decision-making by a two-phase solution framework given the condition-based information during the production process. Specifically, an appropriate job allocation planning can be obtained offline in the first phase of the proposed two-phase solution framework under a limited computing resource. Meanwhile, a condition-based adjustment strategy in the second phase can update the solution based on the in-situ condition information collected from the data platform to achieve higher production efficiency. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","condition-based strategies; interaction; maintenance; Multistage production system","Condition based maintenance; Job shop scheduling; Numerical methods; Production control; Production efficiency; Scheduled maintenance; Condition; Condition-based strategy; Interaction; Job-Shop scheduling; Jobs scheduling; Machine maintenance; Multi-stage production systems; Optimisations; Production system; Resource management; Decision making","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163545613"

Providing sensors, data gathering, local computation and communication capabilities modern CPS fulfil the technical requirements to act completely autonomously in a manufacturing network. While the distribution of decision-making authority to autonomous entities is feasible given such requirements, practice often sees the monopolisation of decision-making authority for centralised control. However, distributed production control approaches might be better suited given current manufacturing challenges, ranging from unreliable supply chains over highly volatile markets, to the demand for increasingly efficient and highly customisable production. In this article, we extend an existing scheduling complexity framework which enables practitioners and researchers alike to assess the aptitude of given manufacturing networks for both centralised and distributed control.

The dynamic flexible job shop scheduling problem (DFJSP) is frequently encountered in the manufacturing industry. However, it is still challenging to obtain high-quality schedules for DFJSP with dynamic job arrivals in real-time, especially facing thousands of operations from a large-scale scene with complex contexts in an assembly plant. This article aims to propose a novel end-to-end hierarchical reinforcement learning framework for solving the large-scale DFJSP in near real-time. In the DFJSP, the processing information of newly arrived jobs is unknown in advance. Besides, two optimization tasks, including job operation selection and job-to-machine assignment, have to be handled, which means multiple actions must be controlled simultaneously. In our framework, a higher-level layer is designed to automatically divide the DFJSP into subproblems, i.e., static FJSPs with different scales. And two lower-level layers are constructed to solve the subproblems. In particular, one layer based on a graph neural network is in charge of sequencing job operations, and another layer based on a multilayer perceptron is used to assign a machine to process the job operations. Numerical experiments, including offline training and online testing, are conducted on several instances with different scales. The results verify the superior performance of the proposed framework compared with existing dynamic scheduling methods, such as well-known dispatching rules and metaheuristics. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dynamic flexible job shop scheduling problem (DFJSP); graph neural network (GNN); hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL); Markov decision process (MDP); real-time optimization","Complex networks; Decision making; Deep learning; Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Hierarchical systems; Job shop scheduling; Learning algorithms; Markov processes; Reinforcement learning; Dispatching; Dynamic flexible job shop scheduling problem; Dynamic scheduling; Flexible job-shop scheduling problem; Graph neural networks; Heuristics algorithm; Hierarchical reinforcement learning; Job-Shop scheduling; Markov Decision Processes; Real - Time system; Realtime optimizations (RTO); Schedule; Real time systems","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85159843114"

The purpose of this study is to identify and evaluate the sustainable enablers of AM. The research has identified 19 sustainable enablers of AM belonging to three areas: social, economic, and environmental, through an in-depth literature review. The decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) approach has been applied after taking inputs from industry experts to develop causal relationships (cause-effect diagram) and to analyze each enabler's influence. The cause-effect diagram has been developed based on threshold values. Our observations revealed that weight reduction, reduced time to market, mass customization, and personalization are the most critical enablers for sustainability. From visual representation, reduced toxicity of materials, no need for tooling, and ease of accessibility for remote part production have a substantial impact on effect enablers. This study will facilitate AM practitioners to systematically identify and prioritize essential enablers from a sustainability perspective. Practitioners should focus on these cause group enablers because it will help in controlling the effect of group enablers to improve sustainability in operations. Furthermore, insights from the study will enable policymakers to make policies leading to sustainable development. The novelty lies in identifying 19 enablers and incorporating the DEMATEL model to assess the causal relationship. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","3-D printing; additive manufacturing (AM); circular economy; decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL); sustainability","3D printers; Planning; Sonar; Sustainable development; 3-D printing; Additive manufacturing; Causal relationships; Circular economy; Decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory; Decisions makings; Effect diagrams; Manufacturing; Operations analysis; Three-dimensional-printing; Decision making","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139509033"

Manufacturers need third-party logistics (3PLs) to provide services in the production process to quickly deliver finished products to customers. However, the two have very different batch processing of cus-tomer orders: manufacturers merge customer orders with identical demands, while 3PLs merge customer orders in prox-imate regions. Consequently, when both manufacturers and 3PLs are involved in decision-making, the efficiency and economy of production-logistics operations are severely compromised under batch processing. Therefore, the key issue ad-dressed in this paper is how to achieve production-delivery synchronization under batch processing mode, as well as synchronized control in a highly dynamic environment. To ad-dress this issue, a digital twin-based production-delivery synchronized decision framework is proposed, centered on the concept of 'cloud-edge-terminal'. A synchronization control mechanism based on digital twin is designed. A collaborative optimization-based synchronized mathematical model and optimization algorithm are developed.

Sustainable and just-in-time scheduling attracts attention due to increasing environmental regulation and customer awareness regarding energy consumption and on-time delivery. This study investigates a sustainable, flexible job shop scheduling problem with transportation and sequence-dependent setup times, addressing the need to balance operational efficiency with environmental responsibility in modern manufacturing. Unlike traditional approaches that focus solely on cost minimization, this research formulates a bi-objective mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model that minimizes total earliness/tardiness costs (ETC) and total carbon emissions (TCE). Minimizing earliness and tardiness costs by optimizing the order sequence to meet due date requirements enhances customer satisfaction. Simultaneously, minimizing carbon emissions promotes resource utilization and minimizes environmental impact through reduced energy consumption in order processing, machine setup and idle state, job transportation, and auxiliary equipment. The results demonstrate that the proposed MILP model effectively tackles small to medium-sized instances, pinpointing optimal solutions that carefully balance operational efficiency with environmental sustainability. A balanced model with equal weights for ETC and TCE reduced carbon emissions by 5403.37 kg compared to a customer-focused approach, highlighting the trade-off between cost and environmental performance. This study employs the Gurobi optimizer to obtain optimal or near-optimal solutions, providing manufacturers with a decision-making tool for more sustainable and efficient production schedules. The findings underscore the importance of strategic scheduling that balances customer satisfaction and environmental sustainability.

Accurate tourist arrival forecasting is crucial for governments and industry players for strategic planning. In this study, a CNN-BiLSTM model was developed as a more accurate forecasting method using historical airport and port arrival data. This research explores ten different hyperparameter combinations to find the best configuration, with hyperparameters including dropout rate, batch size, learning rate, optimizer, activation function, and data split proportions. The experimental results indicate that the optimal hyperparameter combination, particularly with a small batch size (10), a higher learning rate (0.005), the Adam optimizer, and the Tanh activation function, and 60:40 train-to-test data ratio, delivers the best performance with the lowest RMSE and MAPE for the Jakarta and Riau Islands regions. The CNN-BiLSTM model has proven effective in handling seasonal data and fluctuations in tourist arrival patterns, especially in Jakarta, which exhibits a more stable pattern. Conversely, the model's performance in the Riau Islands is affected by more unstable seasonal pattern variations and extreme anomalies, resulting in a higher MAPE.

This work aims to solve the energy-efficient distributed flexible job shop scheduling problem (EDFJSP) while simultaneously minimizing makespan and energy consumption. Some gaps are stated following: 1) the previous works usually adopt the memetic algorithm (MA) with variable neighborhood search. However, the local search (LS) operators are inefficient due to strong randomness; 2) the confidence-based adaptive operator selection model follows the experiences of the major crowds, which ignores the efficient operators with low weight, so it can not select the really efficient operator; 3) the previous works lack of efficient strategy to save energy; and 4) the mainstream memetic framework adopts LS to all solutions, which causes the population to converge too quickly and the diversity is extremely reduced. Thus, we propose a surprisingly popular-based adaptive MA (SPAMA) to overcome the above deficiencies. The contributions are as follows: 1) four problem-based LS operators are employed to improve the convergence; 2) a surprisingly popular degree (SPD) feedback-based self-modifying operators selection model is proposed to find the efficient operators with low weight and correct crowd decision making; 3) the full active scheduling decoding is presented to reduce the energy consumption; and 4) an elite strategy is designed to balance the resources between global and LS. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of SPAMA, it is compared with state-of-the-art algorithms on Mk and DP benchmarks. The results demonstrate the superiority of SPAMA to the state-of-art algorithms for solving EDFJSP. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Distributed flexible job scheduling; energy efficient; memetic algorithm (MA); multiobjective optimization; surprisingly popular algorithm (SPA)","Decision making; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Job shop scheduling; Scheduling algorithms; Distributed flexible job scheduling; Energy efficient; Energy-consumption; Job-Shop scheduling; Jobs scheduling; Memetic; Memetic algorithm; Memetic algorithms; Multi-objectives optimization; Optimisations; Production facility; Surprisingly popular algorithm; Multiobjective optimization; article; comparative effectiveness; controlled study; decision making; energy consumption; human; memetic algorithm; neighborhood","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85162669563"

This study investigates a production scheduling and vehicle routing problem in a make-to-order context under a decentralized decision-making structure. Specifically, two different decision makers hierarchically decide the production and distribution schedules to minimize their incurred costs and we formulate the problem as a bi-level mixed-integer optimization model as a static Stackelberg game between manufacturer and distributor. At the upper level, the manufacturer decides its best scheduling under a flexible job-shop manufacturing system, and at the lower level, the distributor decides its distribution scheduling (routing) which influences the upper-level decisions. The model derives the best production- distribution scheduling scheme, with the objective of minimizing the cost of the manufacturer (leader) at the lowest possible cost for the distributor (follower). As the lower level represents a mixed-integer programming problem, it is challenging to solve the resulting bi-level model. Therefore, we extend an efficient decomposition algorithm based on Duplication Method and Column Generation. Finally, to discuss the decentralization value, the results of the presented bi-level model are compared with those of the centralized approach. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bi-level mixed-integer programming; Decentralized production- distribution scheduling; Decomposition algorithm; Flexible job-shop; Supply chain management","Decision making; Integer programming; Job shop scheduling; Linear programming; Production control; Scheduling algorithms; Vehicle routing; Bi-level mixed-integer programming; Bi-level models; Decentralisation; Decentralized production; Decentralized production- distribution scheduling; Decomposition algorithm; Distribution scheduling; Flexible job shops; Mixed-Integer Programming; Production distribution; Supply chain management","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85179134983"

For the enterprises with daily delivered production tasks, the random job arrivals are regular. Thus, the Distributed Job-shop Scheduling Problem (DJSP) with random job arrivals is studied, and it is a typical case from the equipment manufacturing industry. The DJSP involves two coupled decision-making processes, job assigning and job sequencing, and the distributed and uncertain production environment requires the scheduling method to be more responsive and adaptive. Thus, a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based multi-agent method is explored, and it is composed of the assigning agent and the sequencing agent. Two Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) are formulated for the two agents respectively. In the MDP for the assigning agent, fourteen factory-and-job related features are extracted as the state features, seven composite assigning rules are designed as the candidate actions, and the reward depends on the total processing time of different factories. In the MDP of the sequencing agent, five machine-and-job related features are set as the state features, six sequencing rules make up the action space, and the change of the factory makespan is the reward. Besides, to enhance the learning ability of the agents, a Deep Q-Network (DQN) framework with variable threshold probability in the training stage is designed, which can balance the exploitation and exploration in the model training. The proposed multi-agent method's effectiveness is proved by the independent utility test and the comparison test that are based on 1350 production instances, and its practical value in the actual production is implied by the case study from an automotive engine manufacturing company. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deep reinforcement learning; Distributed manufacturing; Multi-agent; Shop scheduling","Behavioral research; Costs; Decision making; Deep learning; Job shop scheduling; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Markov processes; Multi agent systems; Deep reinforcement learning; Distributed job; Distributed manufacturing; Job shop scheduling problems; Markov Decision Processes; Multi agent; Production cost; Reinforcement learnings; Shop scheduling; State feature; Reinforcement learning","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173274746"

Green scheduling is acknowledged as an effective weapon to reduce energy consumption in the industrial sectors. Therefore, this paper is devoted to the green scheduling of flexible manufacturing cells (FMC) with auto-guided vehicle transportation, where conflict-free routing of the vehicles is considered. To deal with this problem, a bi-objective optimization model is proposed to achieve the minimization of the maximum completion time and the total energy consumption in an FMC. The studied problem is an extension of flexible job shop problem which is NP-hard. Thus, an improved bi-objective salp swarm algorithm based on decomposition (IMOSSA/D) is proposed and applied to the problem. The approach is based on the decomposition of the bi-objective problem. Salp swarm intelligence along with three stochastic-distribution-based operators are incorporated into the approach, to enhance and balance its exploring and exploiting ability. Computational experiments are performed to compare the proposed approach with two state-of-the-art algorithms. This study allows the decision makers to better trade-off between energy savings and production efficiency in flexible manufacturing cellular environment. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Automated guided vehicle; Bi-objective; Energy-efficiency; Flexible manufacturing cell; Salp swarm algorithm; Stochastic-distribution-based operators","Automatic guided vehicles; Cellular manufacturing; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Energy utilization; Flexible manufacturing systems; Job shop scheduling; Mobile robots; Production efficiency; Stochastic systems; Automated guided vehicles; Bi objectives; Flexible manufacturing; Flexible manufacturing cell; Green scheduling; Salp swarm algorithm; Salp swarms; Stochastic distribution; Stochastic-distribution-based operator; Swarm algorithms; Energy efficiency","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168142061"

With the development of intelligent manufacturing, automated guided vehicles (AGVs), which are the key transportation equipment for manufacturing enterprises, have been widely used for their high flexibility and stability. In addition, the increase in energy consumption and the trend of green manufacturing make it critical to take into account energy-related objectives in the decision-making of scheduling. Therefore, the multi-objective green scheduling problem of integrated flexible job shop and AGVs (MOGSP-IFJS&AGVs) is addressed in this paper. To solve this problem effectively, the multi-objective mixed-integer programming (MMIP) model is formulated to minimize total energy consumption and makespan simultaneously. An efficient heuristic algorithm (EHA) is designed to solve the MMIP model. In the EHA, one solution encoding scheme and corresponding greedy insertion decoding method considering the selection of AGVs are presented. To acquire a high-quality initial population, the population initialization method balancing the processing time and energy consumption is designed. Further, a local search strategy is presented to enhance the quality of solutions and accelerate the convergence speed of the EHA. Experiment results of 45 test instances indicate that the EHA can obtain better solutions than that of comparison algorithms, which confirms the effectiveness of the EHA for solving the MOGSP-IFJS&AGVs. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Automated guided vehicles; Efficient heuristic algorithm; Flexible job shop; Makespan; Total energy consumption","Automatic guided vehicles; Decision making; Heuristic algorithms; Integer programming; Job shop scheduling; Mobile robots; Automated guided vehicles; Efficient heuristic algorithm; Energy-consumption; Flexible job shops; Green scheduling; Heuristics algorithm; Makespan; Multi objective; Total energy; Total energy consumption; Energy utilization","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85166920185"

Preventive maintenance is often being followed in the industry, which, if not considered while scheduling, may lead to unrealistic/sub-optimal schedules. Despite the importance of maintenance planning while scheduling, the problem has attracted very little attention in the literature. Further, the existing approaches assume centralized decision-making which not only suffers from low scalability but is not amenable to futuristic manufacturing systems such as industry 4.0.

To facilitate near real-time decision-making on the shop floor, we propose a deep multi-agent reinforcement learning-based approach to solve the dynamic job shop scheduling problem.

To ensure uninterrupted production processes and to guarantee the safety of the production personnel, a real-time analysis of the industrial product quality and subsequent decision making are essential. Conventional detection methods have inherent limitations in meeting the real-time demands of processing large volumes of data and achieving high response speeds. For instance, the regular inspection and maintenance of cars can be time-consuming and labor-intensive if performed manually. Furthermore, monitoring the damage situation of bearings in real time through a manual inspection may lead to delays and may hinder production efficiency. Therefore, this paper presents online machine-learning-based methods to address these two practical problems and simulates them on various datasets to meet the requirements of efficiency and speed. Prior to being fed into the network for training, the data undergo identity parsing to transform them into easily identifiable streaming data. The training process demonstrates that online machine learning ensures timely model updates as small batches of data are sent to the network.

Machine learning can support this objective by predicting throughput times on production lines given order specifications. However, this is challenging when manufacturers produce customized products because customization often leads to changes in the probability distribution of operational data—so-called distributional shifts. Distributional shifts can harm the performance of predictive models when deployed to future customer orders with new specifications. The literature provides limited advice on how such distributional shifts can be addressed in operations management. Here, we propose a data-driven approach based on adversarial learning, which allows us to account for distributional shifts in manufacturing settings with high degrees of product customization. We empirically validate our proposed approach using real-world data from a job shop production that supplies large metal components to an oil platform construction yard. Across an extensive series of numerical experiments, we find that our adversarial learning approach outperforms common baselines.

To analyze the influence of immediate predecessor operations on machine tool manufacturing workshops, four forms of immediate predecessor operations with the consideration of uncertain transportation and preparation time are defined. Then, the four forms of immediate predecessor operations are integrated into the FJSP, and a multiobjective FJSP is constructed. An improved optimal foraging algorithm (OFA) and Pythagorean fuzzy set (PFS) are combined to establish a multiobjective optimization algorithm, named PFSOFA. This algorithm is then used to solve the multiobjective FJSP. In PFSOFA, the Pareto fronts are mapped into PFSs. The Pythagorean fuzzy numbers (PFNs) in a PFS are transformed into right triangles, and the distances between the PFNs and the reference PFNs are defined as the distances between their right triangle centroids. Then, all distances of a PFS are integrated by the distance prospect function to obtain a distance prospect value. This value is then used to lead the iteration of PFSOFA.

However, they also need to balance the workload among workers while meeting deadlines. In this research, the dual resource-constraint flexible job-shop scheduling problem with sequencing flexibility (DR-FJSPS) is formulated. The DR-FJSPS deals with decisions made regarding machines, worker assignments, and sequencing flexibility simultaneously in a flexible job-shop environment. Sequencing flexibility is studied in this paper, and precedence relationships of the operations are defined by a directed acyclic graph instead of the traditional linear order. The DR-FJSPS is modelled as a multi-objective problem to minimize conflicting objectives as makespan, maximal worker workload, and weighted tardiness. Due to the intractability of the DR-FJSPS, an elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) with an innovative operator is developed to solve this problem efficiently. The algorithm provides a set of Pareto-optimal solutions that decision-makers can use to evaluate trade-offs between conflicting objectives. Tailor-made instances are introduced to demonstrate the applicability of the model and algorithm. A multi-random-start local search algorithm is developed to assess the effectiveness of the adapted NSGA-II. In addition to that, the multi-objective model is solved using the weighted sum approach. A comparison of the solutions demonstrates that the modified NSGA-II provides a non-dominated efficient set in a reasonable length of time. The benefits of the proposed solution methods, such as defining their everyday schedules, adapting schedules according to management needs, prioritization of makespan, on-time deliveries, and workers’ workload simultaneously, are highlighted. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dual-resource; Evolutionary algorithm; Flexible job-shop scheduling; Multi-objective; NSGA-II; Sequencing flexibility","Decision making; Economic and social effects; Genetic algorithms; Human resource management; Job shop scheduling; Multiobjective optimization; Pareto principle; Conflicting objectives; Dual resource; Flexible job-shop scheduling; Flexible job-shop scheduling problem; Makespan; Multi objective; NSGA-II; Resource Constraint; Sequencing flexibility; Workers'; Directed graphs","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124524461"

The production line can be modeled as an NP-hard constrained flexible job-shop scheduling problem, intractable with mathematical optimization due to its scale. Therefore, decision-making in factories is dominated by handcrafted heuristics. Though machine learning-based approaches proved efficient in solving such problems, their applications are limited due to the lack of trust in the underlying black-box models, and issues with scalability for larger instances. This work presents a genetic programming-based method to generate explainable, improved dispatching heuristics. Our method outputs a set of human-readable dispatching strategies, verifiable by scheduling experts before deployment. In case of minor changes in the environment or the optimization objectives, the continued evolution of the candidate solutions is possible without starting the training process from scratch. The introduced method is evaluated on a simulator executing real-world scale instances. The resulting heuristics improve the key performance indicators of the generated schedules. Furthermore, the generated dispatchers are easy to integrate into existing industrial systems. These favorable properties make the method applicable to various large-scale, dynamic, practical scheduling scenarios, where adaptions to different environments go along with modest human effort limited to the design of a fitness function. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","dispatching heuristics; genetic programming; semiconductor fab","Benchmarking; Constrained optimization; Decision making; Genetic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Job shop scheduling; Semiconductor device manufacture; Decisions makings; Dispatching heuristic; Flexible job-shop scheduling problem; Machine-learning; Manufacturing facility; Mathematical optimizations; NP-hard; Production line; Semiconductor fabs; Semiconductor manufacturing; Genetic programming","Conference paper","Scopus","2-s2.0-85167696164"

Due to their fast applicability and easy handling, they are often used in manufacturing companies to create appropriate production schedules. It has been shown that dispatching rules that are specifically designed for the requirements of a particular environment improve the performance of schedules. Hyper-heuristics based on genetic programming can be used for the automated generation of such dispatching rules. Evolutionary algorithms search the space of dispatching rule components for the most effective priority function to optimize the performance of the resulting schedule. Various studies have highlighted the advantages in the single-objective case, which made it possible to derive a large number of new dispatching rules that exceeded previous benchmark rules. Because it is usually necessary to consider more than one objective simultaneously to ensure effective creation of schedules, the need for a multi-objective optimization method arises. In this paper, we propose an interactive multi-objective optimization method, namely the reference point method, implemented in a hyper-heuristic genetic programming framework. A decision support system has also been developed and implemented in a web-based application to facilitate interaction with the user. Incorporating preferences into the solution process aims to efficiently evolve a dispatching rule that meets the expectations of a decision-maker. A fictitious experiment was carried out in a benchmark job shop environment. The results show that the final solution selected by the decision-maker can produce schedules achieving a desired compromise between the makespan, total tardiness, and total waiting time. Testing the evolved dispatching rule on an independent set of instances and comparing its performance with other benchmark dispatching rules revealed that the proposed method successfully finds dispatching rules that meet the decision-maker’s expectations and are capable of reproducing similar compromise schedules for unseen problems in the same environment. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Decision support system; Genetic programming; Hyper-heuristic; Job shop scheduling; Multi-objective optimization","Artificial intelligence; Benchmarking; Decision making; Decision support systems; Genetic algorithms; Genetic programming; Heuristic methods; Job shop scheduling; Production control; Decision makers; Dispatching rules; Hyper-heuristics; Job-Shop scheduling; Multi-objective job shop scheduling; Multi-objectives optimization; Optimization method; Performance; Preference-based; Simple heuristics; Multiobjective optimization","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85153772857"

Complex problems often require input from production managers or experts even though Industry 4.0 provides advanced technological solutions. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) normally rely more on expert opinion since they face difficulties implementing the newest and most advanced Industry 4.0 technologies. This reliance on human expertise can cause delays in the production processes, ultimately, impacting the efficiency and profitability of the enterprise. As SMEs are mostly niche markets and produce small batches, dynamics in production operations and the need for quick responses cannot be avoided. To address these issues, a decision support method for dynamic production planning (DSM DPP) was developed to optimize the production processes. This method involves the use of algorithms and programming in Matlab to create a decision support module that provides solutions to complex problems in real-time. The aim of this method is to combine not only technical but also human factors to efficiently optimize dynamic production planning. It is hardly noticeable in other methods the involvement of human factors such as skills of operations, speed of working, or salary size. The method itself is based on real-time data so examples of the required I 4.0 technologies for production sites are described in this article—Industrial Internet of Things, blockchains, sensors, etc. Each technology is presented with examples of usage and the requirement for it. Moreover, to confirm the effectiveness of this method, tests were made with real data that were acquired from a metal processing company in Lithuania. The method was tested with existing production orders, and found to be universal, making it adaptable to different production settings. This study presents a practical solution to complex problems in industrial settings and demonstrates the potential for DSM DPP to improve production processes while checking the latest data from production sites that are conducted through cloud systems, sensors, IoT, etc. The implementation of this method in SMEs could result in significant improvements in production efficiency, ultimately, leading to increased profitability. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","dynamic decision support method; Industry 4.0; production optimization; smart production planning","Decision support systems; Human engineering; Industry 4.0; Internet of things; Production control; Production efficiency; Profitability; Wages; Complex problems; Decision supports; Dynamic decision; Dynamic decision support method; Production optimization; Production Planning; Production process; Small and medium-sized enterprise; Smart production planning; Support method; MATLAB","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85159204910"

Our proposed model is inspired by automotive glass manufacturing, where maximizing the surface area of manufactured safety glass during a given time frame is the key performance measure. We first develop the model of a traditional job shop with a set of stations, each with a particular number of machines, with distinct production performance levels, according to their utilization stage. Each product type needs to be processed on a subset of these stations according to a predefined sequence. Customers place their orders independently over time, specifying the units required of each product type. The inter-arrival of orders (demand) and processing times are assumed to be stochastic. We also suppose that the technicians have varied skill sets, according to which they can only work at a certain subgroup of stations, and variable availability depending on sick leave, vacations, etc. Hence, in order to maximize the predefined productivity index, the optimal assignment of technicians to the stations based on their skill sets and availability during each shift becomes a complex decision-making process. Given the stochastic and dynamic nature of this problem, we model the setting as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). Given its size, we propose to solve it using Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP). We address the exponential growth of the action space by using a hill-climbing algorithm for action selection. To show the performance and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, we use real company data and compare the results of the algorithm with the current policy in use, as well as other proposed policies. Applying our proposed method resulted in an average improvement of 15% in productivity compared to the best performing benchmark policy. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Approximate dynamic programming; Dynamic programming; Job-shops; Workforce planning","Behavioral research; Decision making; Employment; Glass; Job shop scheduling; Manufacture; Markov processes; Productivity; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Approximate algorithms; Approximate dynamic programming; Demand uncertainty; Demand variability; Dynamic assignment; Job-shop; Product types; Skill sets; Skilled workforces; Workforce planning; Dynamic programming","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138803589"

Increasingly manufactures are looking for new solutions that allow them to become more energy efficient and sustainable. Regarding energy cost issue, it is well known that the electricity costs in manufacturing systems strongly depend on the reached peak power. On the other hand, the power required by a manufacturing system affects the adoption of renewable energy sources. The use of renewables, indeed, encompasses fluctuations in energy supply and requires adapting production processes to a power constraint. The article proposes a decision model for the scheduling in a job-shop manufacturing system that simultaneously deals with the power constraint and the variable speed of machine tools. Defining the maximum value of the usable power, decisions can be taken on production scheduling, by adapting the processing speed of several machines that work simultaneously, to the power availability. The model allows decision makers to plan production, taking into account the impossibility of exceeding a certain power and assuming the minimization of the makespan as an objective function. Managers can utilize the scheduling model in all the different contexts, where there is a power limit. The test cases show how the proposed model allows to obtain an efficient scheduling under a constant and variable power constraint. The findings highlight that the model can be employed to reduce the peak power and encourage the use of renewables in manufacturing systems, thus obtaining an efficient scheduling and a more sustainable production. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Decision model; job-shop; power constraint; production planning; renewable energy; scheduling","Costs; Decision making; Energy efficiency; Job shop scheduling; Machine tools; Manufacture; Planning; Production control; Renewable energy resources; Decision modeling; Job-shop; Job-Shop scheduling; Manufacturing; Power constraints; Production Planning; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Scheduling; Sustainable development","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85114734680"

The setup and transportation times are quite significant in flexible job shops, which recently have attracted attention. This paper deals with the problem of scheduling of flexible job shops, termed FJSP, with setup and transportation times. Several metaheuristics approaches have been proposed for the problem assuming centralized decision-making. The centralized approaches, however, may not be suitable for large complex problems due to higher computational effort and slower convergence. The decentralized approaches are more suitable for such problems. To the best of authors’ knowledge, no work has been reported towards developing a decentralized approach for FJSP with setup and transportation times. To fill this gap a multi-agent system, a popular decentralized approach, is developed for FJSP with setup and transportation time. The performance of the proposed approach is compared with the three state-of-the-art (centralized) approaches by solving 20 problem instances. The proposed approach has been found to produce schedules with makespan lower (maximum of 35% and an average of 10.27%) than the comparison approaches.

In the context of dynamic scheduling, the decision-maker should simultaneously minimize economic objectives within the decision space and violation penalty out of the decision space. In this study, we introduce a resilient scheduling model in steelmaking plants, which provides flexible decisions, including buffering times in between stages and controllable processing speeds in the casting stage, to enable the solution to absorb random disturbances and recover quickly. We formulate the dynamic steelmaking scheduling problem with resilient responding strategies, which is a variant of dynamic multi-objective optimization problems (DMOP), and propose a resilient scheduling optimization framework to solve it over time. First, we employ a vector with problem-specific knowledge to map the whole decision space to sub-schedules in the casting stage, which contains casting priority, casting speed and scaling ratio. Next, we form a multi-objective linear programming model to evaluate these problem-specific vectors. Last but not least, we develop a self-learning based dynamic multi-objective differential evolutionary algorithm to solve the variant DMOP, in which a hypothesis-testing technique is used to detect and identify environmental changes. The sensitivity analysis and algorithm comparisons are performed on a wide range of problem instances under dynamic environments. Experimental evidence validates that the proposed resilient model and the optimization framework is effective to solve the dynamic scheduling problem in steelmaking plants. Note to Practitioners - This paper investigates a dynamic scheduling problem that comes from steelmaking manufacturing systems and is extensively studied in existing works. Because a decision-maker only has incomplete knowledge about the realistic environments, this paper simultaneously considers that both the decision and objective space of a scheduling problem dynamically changed over time. We develop a resilient scheduling model which can absorb the different types or scales of disturbances caused by unforeseen events, and recover rapidly to the original state. We formulate the resilience scheduling model and propose a dynamic multi-objective algorithm based on the self-learning differential evolutionary algorithm to solve it. The effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithm is validated via sensitivity analysis and comparison to other well-known algorithms. Furthermore, the resilient scheduling model and its optimization framework can also be applied to dynamic scheduling problems in other industries. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dynamic scheduling; evolutionary optimization; multi-objective; self-learning; steelmaking","Decision making; Evolutionary algorithms; Learning algorithms; Linear programming; Manufacture; Multiobjective optimization; Production control; Scheduling; Sensitivity analysis; Testing; Vector spaces; Dynamic scheduling; Evolutionary optimizations; Heuristics algorithm; Job-Shop scheduling; Multi objective; Optimisations; Self-learning; Steelmaking plants; Heuristic algorithms","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132539718"

To support this migration, it is necessary to make intelligence decisions that benefit from automatic design of search algorithms. Considering these, this paper addresses the distributed hybrid flow shop scheduling problem with multiprocessor tasks (DHFSP-MT) as an extension of the hybrid flow shop scheduling problem with multiprocessor tasks (HFSP-MT) to minimize the maximum completion time among distributed factories. To provide effective decision support, we apply a novel framework called conditional markov chain search (CMCS) to automate the generation of heuristics, which is presented for the first time in the distributed shop scheduling problem to the best of our knowledge. We express the HFSP-MT as a markov decision process (MDP) and solve it through a hybrid Q-learning-local search algorithm. By using the characteristics of the problem under study, we introduce two new concepts, weight and impact, which are used to develop an initial construction algorithm and two local search methods.

In the field of production, group technology (GT) is defined by identifying and grouping similar parts based on their similarities in design and production. Cellular manufacturing (CM) is an application of GT to reconfigure the factory and job shop design. A manufacturing cell is a group of independent machines with different functions put together to produce a family of parts. Designing a cellular manufacturing system involves three major decisions: cell formation (CF), group layout (GL), and group scheduling (GS). Although these decisions are interrelated and can affect each other, they have been considered separately or sequentially in previous research. In this paper, CF, GL, and GS decisions are considered simultaneously. Accordingly, a multi-objective linear programming (MOLP) model is proposed to optimize weighted completion time, transportation cost, and machine idle time for a multi-product system. Finally, the model will be solved using the ϵ-constraint method, representing different scales solutions for decision-making. The proposed model is NP-hard. Therefore, a nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) is presented to solve it since GAMS software is unable to find optimal solutions for large-scale problems. Besides, to evaluate the performance of NSGA-II, the problem is solved by three metaheuristic algorithms. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cell formation; Cellular manufacturing system; Group layout; Group scheduling; Group technology; Multi-objective linear programming","Cellular manufacturing; Decision making; Genetic algorithms; Job shop scheduling; Linear programming; Multiobjective optimization; Cell formation; Cellular manufacturing systems; Group layouts; Group scheduling; Linear programming models; Multi-objective linear programming; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Nondominated sorting genetic algorithm; Part based; Parts families; Group technology","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142761498"

Regarding the current limitations, little research has been done on the relationship between batch sizing and the amount of information needed for production management. This paper first constructs the functional expression between the number of batches and the system entropy according to the measured property of entropy itself. Then, the two theorems on the relationship between the number of batches and the system entropy are theoretically put forward for the first time, i.e., an increase in the number of batches will reduce the system entropy, thus reducing the information required to manage production. Also, the two theorems are fully proved based on the proposed functions. In an empirical study, the variations between the system entropy functions and the number of batches are comparatively analyzed by designating two cases of 10 and 20 machining units. Consequently, the results of graphical representation once again illustrate the validity of the developed two theorems. The conclusions of this study not only provide a crucial information-theoretic basis for the feasible arrangement of batch size with an expert decision support system but contribute to guiding practical production for assembly line managers. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Batch sizing; Function model; Information entropy; Production line","Artificial intelligence; Assembly; Decision support systems; Information management; Information theory; Manufacture; Batch sizes; Batch sizing; Decisions makings; Entropy function; Flow-shops; Function modelling; Function theorems; Information entropy; Manufacturing enterprise; Production line; Decision making","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140739454"

However, the existing works face challenges in dealing with flexibility, which allows an operation to be scheduled on one out of multiple machines and is often required in practice. Such one-to-many relationship brings additional complexity in both decision making and state representation. This article considers the well-known flexible job-shop scheduling problem and addresses these issues by proposing a novel DRL method to learn high-quality PDRs end to end. The operation selection and the machine assignment are combined as a composite decision. Moreover, based on a novel heterogeneous graph representation of scheduling states, a heterogeneous-graph-neural-network-based architecture is proposed to capture complex relationships among operations and machines.

However, programming and configuring robots is time and resource consuming while being also accompanied by high costs that are especially challenging for small- and medium-sized enterprises. The current way of programming industrial robots by using teach-in control devices and/or using vendor-specific programming languages is in general a complex activity that requires extensive knowledge in the robotics domain. It is therefore important to offer new practical methods for the programming of industrial robots that provide flexibility and versatility in order to achieve feasible robotics solutions for small lot size productions. This paper focuses on the development of a knowledge-driven framework, which should overcome the limitations of state-of-the-art robotics solutions and enhance the agility and autonomy of industrial robotics systems using ontologies as a knowledge-source. The framework includes reasoning and perception abilities as well as the ability to generate plans, select appropriate actions, and finally execute these actions. In this context, a challenge is the fusion of vision system information with the decision-making component, which can use this information for generating the assembly tasks and executable programs. The introduced product model in the form of an ontology enables that the framework can semantically link perception data to product models to consequently derive handling operations and required tools. Besides, the framework enables an easier adaption of robot-based production systems for individualized production, which requires swift configuration and efficient planning. The presented approach is demonstrated in a laboratory environment with an industrial pilot test case. Our application shows the potential to reduce the efforts needed to program robots in an automated production environment. In this context, the benefits as well as shortcomings of the approach are also discussed in the paper. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Automated planning; Industrial robot; Ontology; Perception","Application programs; Decision making; Manufacture; Ontology; Robot programming; Automated planning; Complex manufacturing process; High costs; Industrial robotic systems; Ontology's; Product models; Robotic solutions; Robotic systems; Small and medium-sized enterprise; Small batch production; Industrial robots","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85113135885"

Manufacturing companies are under the influence of social, economic, and political trends that urge them to accelerate product development timelines while simultaneously achieving greater flexibility and resource efficiency. Amid these challenges, manufacturing companies commonly grapple with the task of defining key value streams within their production processes. This challenge is especially relevant for high-variety, low-volume businesses where value streams may include a high number of products and components. The identification of these key value streams offers a pathway to improve decision-making, shedding light on the primary sources of complexity that impede operational efficiency. Central to this endeavour is a comprehensive grasp of production flows. In the context of Industry 4.0, the expanded accessibility of data sourced from factory operations opens doors to novel prospects, facilitating a more profound understanding of production flows. Following the long-standing principles of Production Flow Analysis, which have played a pivotal role in defining value streams over the years, we present an approach for discerning these value streams by harnessing production data through process mining and machine learning techniques.

This makes adopting I4.0 particularly challenging for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as they cannot afford investment failures due to severely constrained resources. Despite various studies on SME-specific adoption barriers and methodical approaches, there is no systematic overview of how existing approaches address which barriers. This would be essential to better understand and help develop targeted approaches for successfully adopting I4.0 in SMEs. Based on a systematic literature review, this paper identifies, categorizes and maps I4.0 adoption barriers and existing methodical approaches. Aside from a socio-technical barrier taxonomy, the mapping identifies groups of well-supported barriers and barriers with only limited or even no dedicated approaches.

Hence, this paper delves into the realm of dynamic job shop scheduling, where job arrivals occur randomly. It introduces a real-time smart scheduling framework grounded in deep reinforcement learning. The scheduling agent is trained through proximal policy optimization, while the environment is built upon discrete event simulation. Additionally, a structured approach is devised, encompassing independent states, actions, and rewards for decision-making. To enhance convergence performance, reward scaling techniques are implemented. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted across various production configurations. The results demonstrate that the PPO-based approach can outperform dispatch rules and two hyper-heuristics in most untrained scenarios within a comparable computational time frame.

DT is essentially a virtual representation of physical equipment and processes that are connected to the physical environment using an online data-sharing infrastructure within the Manufacturing Execution System (MES). In the case of reactive scheduling, DT is used to detect fluctuations in the scheduling plan and execute rescheduling plans. In proactive scheduling, it is used to simulate different production scenarios and optimize future states of production operations. Replicating detailed simulation models in most PS cases is highly computationally intensive, which negates against the main goal of DT (online decision making).

Additionally, incomplete, uncertain, and ambiguous information hampers adequate decision making and control. This is especially the case in configure-to-order environments, where there is a high variability in processes. Consequently, standard software solutions often fail to allow for the required flexibility, adaptability, and agility. Moreover, in industry, software solutions (be it PLM, ERP, IoT, …, MES or CAQ solutions), oftentimes tend to become dominant factors in primary processes, thus further stifling the anticipated flexibility. If, however, these software solutions - here conjointly referred to as Digital Infrastructure - are regarded as subcontractors in a digital twinning approach, the primary targets in production/assembly can remain the driver in the overall process. This paper depicts how this digital twinning approach can be used to establish versatile and adaptive information provisioning. To ensure that the approach is not merely a theoretical discourse, the approach is depicted based on a case study. This case study, embedded in a Dutch manufacturing company for special needs bicycles, is rooted in e.g., the seasonal fluctuation in the market, on the broad product portfolio, but foremost on the ability to strengthen customisation as the unique selling point in that portfolio. For this reason, a use case focuses especially on one of the most demanding parts of the production/assembly-line: the welding robot digital twin for frame welding. On the one hand, this twin encounters all product variants and exceptions; moreover, this twinning approach will aim to provide decision support for upscaling of the production facilities.

Feasible or optimal scheduling of work orders for product portfolios is subject to a sequence of combinations of work orders. Thus, it involves many scheduling models. It is beyond the scope of a single scheduling model to address this issue. Many mathematical scheduling models and hybrid dispatching rules are too complex to be included in a packaged ERP solution, and they may not even be necessary at the enterprise-wide decision-making level. Therefore, we developed a static scheduling program for job shop problems and conducted experiments in which we tested the ten most common dispatching rules in various scenarios. According to the testing results, seven dispatching rules are suitable for most scenarios and recommended for ERP system implementation. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dispatching Rule; ERP; Production and Marketing Coordination; Scheduling","Commerce; Decision making; Enterprise resource planning; Job shop scheduling; Software testing; Decisions makings; Dispatching rules; Optimal scheduling; Product portfolios; Production and marketing coordination; Production line; Scheduling; Scheduling models; Utility performance; Work order; Marketing","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85181022343"

The production process generates a large amount and variety of data, and the production strategy is complex and variable. The generation of scheduling strategies needs to consider the actual production status of the workshop and the disturbances in the current status to ensure that the scheduling results meet the actual order requirements. This paper proposes a dynamic scheduling optimization strategy based on workshop big data. We design a big data-based scheduling optimization computing framework, which integrates big data resources such as workshop machine tool processing status, workpiece processing information, and order information to obtain relevant data affecting processing in real-time, and quickly respond to changes in workshop factors to ensure consistency between scheduling constraints and actual situations. In addition, we have improved the traditional genetic algorithm and the method of calculating the fitness value, solving the problem of deviation from the original scheduling plan caused by the disturbance of urgent order insertion, rework and repair, machine tool maintenance, and scheduling time. This improves the real-time and dynamic decision-making of machining scheduling. The proposed scheduling optimization strategy has been applied to a certain aviation engine machining workshop, reducing the overall machining time and improving machining efficiency compared to the original scheduling strategy of the workshop. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","big data; dynamic scheduling; flexible job shop scheduling problem; genetic algorithm","Big data; Data handling; Decision making; Job shop scheduling; Machine tools; Scheduling algorithms; Complex Processes; Current status; Dynamic scheduling; Flexible job-shop scheduling problem; Large amounts; Optimization strategy; Production process; Production strategy; Scheduling optimization; Scheduling strategies; Genetic algorithms","Conference paper","Scopus","2-s2.0-85175524667"

In this paper, we exploit the flexibility inherent in some jobs, their schedules, and their energy consumption to model an energy-centric flexible job shop scheduling problem. We assume that there is limited electrical energy to power machines, and we attempt to match the schedules of machine jobs to the available energy with the objective of minimizing the energy consumption. We propose that collective learning, i.e., a form of decentralized (and unsupervised) learning where autonomous agents coordinate their decision-making to collectively learn and manage tasks that can be efficiently performed by coordination, can be employed to achieve this. We present a methodology that combines a plangeneration algorithm with a collective-learning tool - Iterative Economic Planning and Optimized Selections (I-EPOS) - to solve this problem with near optimal-solutions. We apply the methodology to a practical dataset comprising 3 machines and 12 jobs and show that the energy consumption decreases by approximately 5% when they choose and schedule the jobs, instead of acting independently or without any coordination. We also show that it is possible to scale this method to a large number of jobs to obtain reasonable solutions quickly, and that coordination always outperforms uncoordinated and independent actions by increasing the energy savings. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","collective learning; energy consumption; energy efficiency; flexible job shop scheduling; manufacturing industry","Autonomous agents; Decision making; Energy efficiency; Iterative methods; Job shop scheduling; Collective learning; Energy; Energy-consumption; Flexibility in manufacturing; Flexible job-shop scheduling; Flexible resources; Machine availability; Manufacturing industries; Manufacturing process; Resource usage; Energy utilization","Conference paper","Scopus","2-s2.0-85172112008"

Through the simulation of management decision-making process, the demand objectives are classified according to attributes, and different target modules are constructed. According to the actual needs of enterprise production, each target module is sorted or combined. Based on the improved genetic algorithm, a multi-objective decision-making combination optimization model (MODMCOM) with different levels or different structures is established. MODOM fully guarantees the running efficiency of the model and avoids the generation of bad solutions. The most important thing is that this solution model can avoid subjectivity when using traditional decision-making methods to select optimal schemes. By simulating the real process of management decision-making, the model provides a scientific basis for the final scheme selection with the support of intelligent algorithms.

It streamlines mass customization, allows the production of highly complex objects, and has been broadly applied in several fields, from medical devices to the aerospace industry. Although a new era of design possibilities and accessibility was unveiled, most developments are focused on shape reproduction precision and the development of new feeding systems and materials.

Electricity appears to be particularly relevant to operate most types of industrial production equipment in an environmentally friendly manner. Aside from production machines, intralogistics equipment that performs material handling and supplies processes is a further consumer of electricity in an industrial environment. The integration of electricity-intensive intralogistics equipment has, however, hardly been considered in the research on energy-aware production management. With this paper, we present an optimization model that synchronizes intralogistics charging decisions with a production schedule and the availability of renewable electricity in a power grid. Following the Industrie 4.0-paradigm, we use decentralized decision-making within an agent-based platform that coordinates different types of production and intralogistics equipment. We integrate a forecast signal for the availability of renewable energy into this platform to support an environmentally oriented decision process. In a simulation study that is based on real-world data, we analyze the role of intralogistics handling processes and charging operations with respect to a company’s job shop environment and electricity consumption profile. In this simulation, we compare static charging policies in contrast to the proposed optimization model and decentral decision-making under various demand scenarios. The presented approach is shown to be capable of increasing local electricity consumption in times of peak generation of renewable energy, which contributes to CO<inf>2</inf> reductions in industrial manufacturing. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","CO2 emission; decentral decision making; demand response; Intralogistics charging decision; renewable energy","","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85158076571"

Competitiveness in the market has created new challenges, prompting companies to seek fundamental solutions in quality, performance and agility in their processes and products, so the manufacturing execution system (MES) has become indispensable to assist them in this process. The system brings together the company's planning and production, providing access to information displayed in graphs, allowing monitoring and analysis of production, product and equipment status, enabling monitoring of usage, minimizing idle time. The MES function is to manage resources, improve equipment utilization through data trending and historical analysis.

These properties are the priority rank of jobs, sequence-dependent setup times between jobs, machine eligibility, and machine availability. Initially, a mathematical model is proposed for the problem. The solving performance of the proposed model by LINGO is tested with randomly generated toy problems. Since the problem has NP-hard characteristics, heuristic algorithms based on the EDD rule and GTW algorithm are developed to obtain optimal or near-optimal schedules in an acceptable period of time. The success of the algorithms is tested through generated toy problems. It is observed that the combination of Modified EDD and HENOBA algorithms gives optimal or near-optimal solutions.

As a subcontractor, the company is limited by customer constraints and must be able to adapt the process as fast as possible. Therefore, machine programs need to be adapted to control material reactions (i.e., deformations, vibrations, burrs, porosity, etc.) following the laser cutting and welding. Material reactions depend on the gap between theoretical and intrinsic mechanical characteristics of the materials, on the geometry and on the tools used to maintain the parts. The variability of this gap leads to scrap, machine delay and productivity loss. To improve our knowledge, Industry 4.0 provides several technologies enabling the automation of complex tasks. For instance, Artificial Intelligence (IA), supervised or unsupervised, provides opportunities for optimizing and customizing machine programs considering material reactions.

This study considers Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) as an iterative decision-making problem, and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based solution is designed to address these challenges. A deep neural network is utilized for function approximation, and the input feature vectors are extracted iteratively to be used in the sequential decision-making process. The production states are expressed with randomly changing feature vectors of each job’s operations and the corresponding machines.

Traditional centralised manufacture planning is difficult to handle unexpected disturbances. With the aid of new information technologies, resources in SFs become smart and connected to make autonomous decisions. This paper tries to release intelligence of smart connected resources to allocate production tasks and logistics tasks in SFs coordinately and autonomously. The architecture is modelled as an autonomous decision-making manufacturing system with IIoT support, which aims to synchronously allocate manufacturing tasks by the bidding of resources in SFs. Then, a dynamic production-logistics-integrated tasks allocation model is built. The orders makespan and resources utilisation are considered as the objective function, and production resources and logistics resources are integrated to autonomously communicate and interact with each other to bid for dynamic production-logistics integrated operations. To figure out, a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is studied, which makes operations decisions for each job step by step based on in-situ data during manufacturing process.

Agile manufacturing emerged in the late 1990s as a competitive concept to respond to these business challenges. While several seminal research works address agility in terms of concept definition, drivers and strategic capabilities, there is a lack of implementation frameworks of agile manufacturing. The current paper is concerned with the question of how to improve the agility of manufacturing companies. To address this question, a framework is iteratively developed with the aim of supporting decision makers in planning and implementing agility improvement projects. To this end, Design Science Research (DSR) methodology is used in conjunction with CIMO-logic (Context, Intervention, Mechanism, Outcome). The iterative development of the framework relies heavily on insights from case studies and from practitioners in the broad manufacturing sector.

However, printing speed and production volume are two barriers for the adoption of AM for product customization at large scale. Nevertheless, manufacturers could aim to combine the benefits of AM for product customization with traditional mass customization (MC) technologies over the product life cycle (PLC). This approach is showcased in our paper as a manufacturing opportunity and is addressed via a non convex-concave optimization model that considers a monopolist manufacturer producing horizontally differentiated products at scale. To satisfy individual customer preferences under capacity considerations, the firm jointly decides on the inventory, production quantity, product variety, optimal technology-switching times (between AM and MC) and pricing strategy. Our approach can be implemented by decision-makers to leverage customer-centricity and benefit from this novel hybrid manufacturing practice. By deriving a closed-form solution for the production quantity based on an adaptive inventory policy, the resulting optimization problem is solved using the Sample Average Approximation framework grounded by analytical results. Our results demonstrate that the new usage of AM with MC can benefit a manufacturer for customer-centric driven strategies. Significant profit improvements can be achieved with an AM–MC–AM technology-switching scenario under certain capacity conditions and with an increasing-decreasing pricing strategy. Our results also indicate that the benefits of pricing flexibility are highest when capacity is unlimited or when the firm does not hold inventory. Under capacity constraints, a simple decreasing pricing policy combined with inventory performs very well. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Inventory Policy; Manufacturing; Mass Customization; Pricing; Product Life Cycle","3D printers; Additives; Computer aided manufacturing; Customer satisfaction; Decision making; Inventory control; Life cycle; Optimization; Sales; Capacity constraints; Inventory policies; Manufacturing; Mass customization; Pricing strategy; Printing speed; Product customization; Product life cycles; Production quantity; Speed-volume; Costs","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138890456"

Multi-agent control is one strategy that has been proposed to address this challenge. The multi-agent control strategy relies on the decision making and cooperation of a number of intelligent software agents to control and coordinate various components on the shop floor. One of the most important agents for this control strategy is the product agent, which is the decision maker for a single part in the manufacturing system. To improve the flexibility and adaptability of the product agent and its control strategy, this work proposes a direct and active cooperation framework for the product agent. The directly and actively cooperating product agent can identify and actively negotiate scheduling constraints with other agents in the system. A new modeling formalism, based on priced timed automata, and an optimization-based decision making strategy are proposed as part of the framework. Two simulation case studies showcase how direct and active cooperation can be used to improve the flexibility and performance of manufacturing systems. Note to Practitioners - An intelligent product is a product in a manufacturing system that is able to make decisions based on a set of specifications and affect its own production process. Intelligent products have often been proposed to address the challenges associated with small-batch manufacturing and highly customized production. Specifically, by using intelligent products, manufacturers would be able to complete small orders without the need to reconfigure or reschedule operations in the manufacturing system. However, one of the major challenges in the implementation of this control strategy is the need to develop methods that allow intelligent products to cooperate with machines, robots, and other products in a manufacturing system. In this work, we propose a novel direct and active cooperation framework that allows intelligent products to communicate and cooperate with other resources and products on the shop floor. Using the proposed cooperation framework, intelligent products can resolve scheduling conflicts and work together to meet individual specifications (e.g., deadlines). Two case studies, a small job shop and a large semiconductor manufacturing system, showcase how the proposed cooperation framework can be leveraged for different types of applications. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cooperative systems; discrete-event systems; distributed control; dynamic scheduling; multi-agent systems; path planning; smart manufacturing","Discrete event simulation; Distributed parameter control systems; Flexible manufacturing systems; Job shop scheduling; Motion planning; Multi agent systems; Cooperative systems; Decisions makings; Discrete events systems; Distributed-control; Dynamic scheduling; Job-Shop scheduling; Manufacturing; Production facility; Schedule; Smart manufacturing; Smart manufacturing.; Decision making","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126685132"

In this paper, an interoperable scheduling system integrating a proposed scheduling model, along with varying kinds of solving algorithms, are put forward and analyzed through an industrial case study. The case study was decomposed in three application scenarios, for enabling the evaluation of the proposed scheduling model when envisioning the prioritization of internal–makespan-or external–number of tardy jobs-performance measures, along with a third scenario assigning a same importance or weight to both kinds of performance measures. The results obtained enabled us to realize that the weighted application scenario permitted reaching more balanced, thus a potentially more attractive global solution for the scheduling problem considered through the combination of different kinds of scheduling algorithms for the resolution of each underlying sub problem according to the proposed scheduling model. Besides, the decomposition of a global more complex scheduling problem into simpler sub-problems turns them easier to be solved through the different solving algorithms available, while further enabling to obtain a wider range of alternative schedules to be explored and evaluated. Thus, contributing to enriching the scheduling problem-solving process.

An important aspect of production scheduling is the assignment of operators with specific human factors to activities in a manufacturing project. This assignment impacts the duration of the activities, the total wage cost of the project and even the energy consumption during production. With increasing concern regarding low-carbon production in manufacturing, the human factors of operators thus cannot be ignored in the decision-making process in production project scheduling. In this context, our study considers an extension of the well-known resource-constrained project scheduling problem for manufacturing. This problem is represented as a bi-objective optimization problem with the conjoint objectives of minimizing the total cost of the project and its carbon footprint. Two variants of a genetic algorithm-based memetic algorithm (MA) are proposed to solve this problem and a set of artificial, realistic project instances are generated to evaluate the proposed solution procedure. Experimental results show that the proposed MA outperforms the well-known non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms (NSGA-II and NSGA-III) and its enhanced approach (ENSGA-II) in terms of both solution quality and computational efficiency. The experiments are conducted on both real-life case study data from an MTO project in the furniture industry and a large set of artificial data instances.

Traditional dispatching rules and heuristic algorithms solve the production planning and control problems by making schedules. However, the previous methods cannot work well in a changeable workshop environment when encountering a large number of stochastic disturbances of orders and resources. Recently, the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in solving the dynamic scheduling problem has attracted researchers' attention. Therefore, this paper presents a multi-agent manufacturing system based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which integrates the self-organization mechanism and self-learning strategy. Firstly, the manufacturing equipment in the workshop is constructed as an equipment agent with the support of edge computing node, and an improved contract network protocol (CNP) is applied to guide the cooperation and competition among multiple agents, so as to complete personalized orders efficiently. Secondly, a multi-layer perceptron is employed to establish the decision-making module called AI scheduler inside the equipment agent. According to the perceived workshop state information, AI scheduler intelligently generates an optimal production strategy to perform task allocation. Then, based on the collected sample trajectories of scheduling process, AI scheduler is periodically trained and updated through the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm to improve its decision-making performance. Finally, in the multi-agent manufacturing system testbed, dynamic events such as stochastic job insertions and unpredictable machine failures are considered in the verification experiments. The experimental results show that the proposed method is capable of obtaining the scheduling solutions that meet various performance metrics, as well as dealing with resource or task disturbances efficiently and autonomously. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Flexible job-shop scheduling problem; Multi-agent manufacturing system; Proximal policy optimization; Reinforcement learning; Smart manufacturing","Decision making; Deep learning; Job shop scheduling; Learning systems; Manufacture; Multi agent systems; Network protocols; Production control; Reinforcement learning; Stochastic systems; Decisions makings; Dispatching rules; Dynamic job shop scheduling; Flexible job-shop scheduling problem; Multi-agent manufacturing system; Policy optimization; Proximal policy optimization; Reinforcement learnings; Self adjustment; Smart manufacturing; Heuristic algorithms","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85133429544"

Technologies such as blockchain, IoT, and cyber-physical systems have an important role in adopting the personal custom production model. In this study, a reliable and optimized mass customization framework is proposed. The framework has three main contributions. First, the use of Blockchain provides advantages in terms of data persistence, traceability, transparency, and reliability. Second, the production process is optimized by using artificial intelligence methods. A decision support mechanism is proposed for customers who will place orders. As a combination of the contributions, the proposed mass customization framework covers the processes from ordering to production. In addition to contributions such as facilitated customization and reliable data, energy saving in production is increased with the proposed framework.

Modern grids are now tasked with bi-directional flow of power and information. To capitalize on this reality, utilities have designed programs that financially incentivize energy consumers to adjust their energy profile in such a way that is advantageous to the utility. At the same time, users seek to maximize the benefits offered by the utilities. Since this is a complex decision-making process, particularly as users continue to adopt energy storage, solar photovoltaics, and other distributed energy resources, the need for decision support tools is increasingly important. To maximize the financial incentive received by the user, and the benefit gained by the utility, this paper proposes an optimization model to aid manufacturers in operating a battery energy storage device while also using product inventory as additional energy storage. Using inventory as additional energy storage is accomplished by scheduling production to build buffers of inventory during low electricity cost times so that production may be reduced during high electricity cost times. We refer to this problem as the energy job-shop scheduling problem (EJSSP). To accomplish these efforts, a deterministic optimization model is developed in order to determine optimal production and energy storage schedules. It is shown that under the proper conditions, utilities can work directly with energy users such that both parties stand to gain from cooperation with one another. Using several synthetic scenarios, it is found that more flexible manufacturing configurations can have as high as 25% more relative energy cost savings when compared to their more rigid counterparts. Moreover, production scheduling allows inventory to be effectively used as energy storage. Ultimately, the methodology forms the foundation of a gateway for electric utilities and their customers to align their interests and act cooperatively. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Demand-side management; Energy storage; Linear programming; Optimization; Production scheduling","Costs; Decision making; Decision support systems; Demand side management; Electric energy storage; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Energy resources; Production control; Scheduling; Solar power generation; Electrical grids; Electricity costs; End-users; Linear-programming; Manufacturing operations; Optimisations; Optimization models; Power; Production Scheduling; Unidirectional flow; Linear programming","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138462741"

In individual and small batch production, which is characterised by a wide product range, reduced quantities, and short delivery times, cost calculation in forming the price of the product according to customer requirements is of essential importance. Traditional methods of calculating the cost of products in these cases are inefficient, considering the number of offers that need to be made, timing, as well as their competitiveness in the market. For product cost calculation in individual and small batch production, it is necessary to apply modern, efficient methods and models based on the application of artificial intelligence. A wide range of products, which is characteristic of individual and small batch production in some companies, enables the development of modern costing models with the use of basic principles of group technology. The constructional and technological similarity of products enables the formation of groups of similar parts and appropriate group technological processes. Combining that with artificial intelligence, it is possible to develop appropriate cost calculation models.

To solve the above problems, it is necessary to obtain the status and trend changes information and provide information support for the optimization of decision-making and dynamic adjustment of the production system. However, the production system cognition faces the problems of state coupling, state dynamic transfer and transition, and multi-system interweaving, which makes the production system cognition face huge challenges. Combining technologies such as the Internet of Things, industrial big data, and artificial intelligence, cognitive manufacturing can realize dynamic cognition of the production process, support dynamic adjustment, and become a promising way to solve the dynamic changes and uncertainties of production systems. In addition, as a formal expression of information processing and knowledge learning process in cognitive informatics, the Object-Attribute-Relation (OAR) model can effectively guide the construction of the production process cognitive mechanism. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-dimensional cognitive framework based on OAR model of the human cognitive world for the dynamic cognitive needs of production system. The framework carries out dynamic cognition from the three dimensions of the manufacturing unit, production situation, and production system, and builds the continuous cognitive abilities from the three dimensions of analysis, decision-making, and learning. By integrating intelligent algorithms in the fields of artificial intelligence, a computable digital twin model is constructed as a carrier to provide the cognitive enabling technologies and capabilities for the production system. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed framework is illustrated by the developed computational digital twin platform. The computable digital twin platform provides the production system with important cognitive capabilities such as states perception, trend prediction, optimization decision-making, and knowledge learning, to support the dynamic cognition and optimization decision-making of the production system, and lay a technical foundation for adaptive production and cognitive manufacturing. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cognitive framework; Cognitive manufacturing; Computable digital twin; Intelligent manufacturing; Multi-dimensional; OAR model","Artificial intelligence; Cognitive systems; Decision making; Learning systems; Cognitive frameworks; Cognitive manufacturing; Computable digital twin; Decisions makings; Intelligent Manufacturing; Multi dimensional; Object attribute relations; Object-attribute-relation model; Production system; Relation models; Manufacture","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140781263"

However, how to real-timely and properly assign dynamic orders to distributed workshops is a challenging problem. To provide real-time and intelligent decision-making of scheduling for distributed flowshops, we studied the distributed permutation flowshop scheduling problem (DPFSP) with dynamic job arrivals using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The objective is to minimize the total tardiness cost of all jobs. We provided the training and execution procedures of intelligent scheduling based on DRL for the dynamic DPFSP. In addition, we established a DRL-based scheduling model for distributed flowshops by designing suitable reward function, scheduling actions, and state features. A novel reward function is designed to directly relate to the objective. Various problem-specific dispatching rules are introduced to provide efficient actions for different production states. Furthermore, four efficient DRL algorithms, including deep Q-network (DQN), double DQN (DbDQN), dueling DQN (DlDQN), and advantage actor-critic (A2C), are adapted to train the scheduling agent. The training curves show that the agent learned to generate better solutions effectively and validate that the system design is reasonable. After training, all DRL algorithms outperform traditional meta-heuristics and well-known priority dispatching rules (PDRs) by a large margin in terms of solution quality and computation efficiency.

However, manufacturing resources are usually limited so that the preemption relationship exists among robots. Under this circumstance, job scheduling puts forward higher requirements on accuracy and generalization. To this end, this paper proposes a scheduling algorithm to solve job scheduling problems in a resource preemption environment with multi-agent reinforcement learning. The resource preemption environment is modeled as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process, where each job is regarded as an intelligent agent that chooses an available robot according to its current partial observation. Based on this modeling, a multi-agent scheduling architecture is constructed to handle the high-dimension action space issue caused by multi-task simultaneous scheduling. Besides, multi-agent reinforcement learning is employed to learn both the decision-making policy of each agent and the cooperation between job agents. This paper is novel in addressing the scheduling problem in a resource preemption environment and solving the job shop scheduling problem with multi-agent reinforcement learning.

For the fact that most manufacturing systems operate in a dynamic and nondeterministic environment, rescheduling strategies may be beneficial as it serves for adaption of initial schedule to dynamic events. Besides that, the development of modern information technology in manufacturing practice enables the flexibility of production toward alternative process plans. However, very little research has focused on the rescheduling problem integrated with process planning for energy saving. Hence, this work undertakes this challenge by proposing rescheduling decision mechanisms in response to two typical dynamic events with alternative process plans for energy-efficient flexible job shops. More specifically, by modeling the energy consumption of the flexible manufacturing system, the problem is first formulated as a mixed-integer programming optimization model. Rescheduling mechanisms for both new job arrivals and machine tool breakdowns are then designed, based on which a rescheduling algorithm is proposed in the form of a heuristic framework. The significance of the proposed algorithm is exemplified by a comparative case study under various scenarios. Note to Practitioners-The complex process plan selection and dynamic events in flexible job shops make the energy-aware schedule decision a challenging problem. Rescheduling addresses this issue, however, most existing rescheduling algorithms assume that only one process plan is given with a predetermined process route and machine tool allocation. This reduces the effectiveness of energy-saving for such a dynamic and flexible manufacturing system. This article, for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, proposes rescheduling decision mechanisms to generate schedules that can adapt to dynamic events and are energy-efficient with process plan flexibility. It may assist decision-makers to provide more practical and applicable energy-efficient schedules for flexible job shops, particularly when dynamic variations of the production environment occurred frequently. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Alternative process plans; decision-making system; dynamic events; energy-efficient rescheduling","Cutting tools; Decision making; Dynamics; Energy efficiency; Environmental impact; Flexible manufacturing systems; Heuristic algorithms; Integer programming; Job shop scheduling; Machine tools; Scheduling algorithms; Alternative process plans; Decision-making systems; Dynamic events; Dynamic scheduling; Energy efficient; Energy-consumption; Energy-efficient rescheduling.; Heuristics algorithm; Job-Shop scheduling; Task analysis; Energy utilization","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85117073057"

Customized production can be achieved by introducing reconfigurable production systems (RMS). The customized flexibility and several characteristics of RMSs provide many opportunities in terms of process and production planning. However, those characteristics greatly increase the complexity of the design and planning of production systems. This paper presents a decision support system relying on a skill-based approach to design a reconfigurable assembly line considering the planning of assembly processes and monitoring. The proposed decision aid system is modular in design and is composed of four modules. The main input data is a CAD model of a new product variant for the identification of the assembly and monitoring requirements. Besides, a current assembly system layout with its resource descriptions exists. In the first developed module, assembly-by-disassembly and a skill-based approach are used to generate different assembly plans. In the second module, feature recognition and skill-based approaches generate process monitoring alternatives. The third module uses a linear program (LP) that aims to minimize the total cost of workstation activation and reconfiguration, as well as cycle time, and to maximize the process quality of the assembly tasks. A user-based generative model design approach is applied to optimize the values of three objective functions. In the fourth and final module, a simulation of the optimized assembly plan allows either the validation of the assembly plan and process monitoring plan or initiates a new iteration due to their infeasibility. To further demonstrate how the proposed methodology works, some computational experiments are provided for two use cases. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Assembly; CAD analysis; Decision support system; Feature recognition; Optimization; Reconfigurable manufacturing system; Skill-based approach","Artificial intelligence; Assembly; Computer aided design; Iterative methods; Linear programming; Process control; Process monitoring; Production control; Assembly planning; CAD analyse; Customer need; Feature based approaches; Features recognition; Optimisations; Planning process; Product variety; Reconfigurable manufacturing system; Skill-based approach; Decision support systems","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137497501"

Within the second echelon, the suppliers fall into clusters of product supply networks based on their capability to produce a part. OEM in our setting is interested in determining the optimal tolerances for its supply network members to operate so as to minimize the variability introduced into the total supply chain costs. To obtain the optimal supplier-selection and order-allocations under a periodic review demand policy, we model the problem as a mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) formulation.

Furthermore, there is a limit in the maximum amount of the resource that can be consumed, so the problem serves to model either a constraint on the energy or raw material employed in the process, or on the maximum amount of pollutant that can be emitted. In contrast to the classical permutation flowshop scheduling problem, in the variant under study the processing times are controllable, there is an specific resource consumption, and each job has a due date. The objective function considered is the minimization of the total tardiness of the jobs. Given the NP-hard nature of this problem, we focus onto developing approximate solution procedures that can yield high-quality solutions with a reasonable CPU effort. More specifically, we develop a fast solution procedure to build an initial solution and two hybrid matheuristics based on mixed-integer linear programming formulations of the problem.

However, individual equipment degradations, complex system structures, and global network layout bring challenges for the real-time decision-making. This article comprehensively develops a service-outsourcing progressive opportunistic maintenance methodology for a global service-outsourcing network with prognostic updating and dynamical optimization. At the equipment layer, an automated prognostic model is utilized to characterize and update the individual path of each leased equipment's degradation signals. At the local layer, an opportunistic maintenance policy is developed for balancing production capacity and optimizing maintenance decisions of each system with even series-parallel structure. At the global layer, a routing optimization policy is proposed for the service-outsourcing network by integrating service time windows and multiple geographical locations to optimize the service route of required maintenance teams and the service start time of each group set.

Emerging digital twin (DT) technology can help detect disturbances by continuously comparing physical space with virtual space and triggering a rescheduling policy immediately after a disturbance. This enables dynamic scheduling and greatly reduces the deviation between preschedules and actual schedules. This study focuses on a DT-enabled integrated optimisation problem of flexible job shop scheduling and flexible preventive maintenance (PM) considering both machine and worker resources. A double-layer Q-learning algorithm (DLQL) is designed as the underlying key optimisation method to simultaneously learn the selection process of machines and operations to achieve efficient real-time scheduling. The superior solution performance of DLQL was verified by comparing it with two well-known metaheuristic algorithms and a single-layer Q-learning algorithm under several benchmarks.

It requires complex routing and sequencing decisions under unpredicted dynamic events. Genetic programming (GP), as a hyperheuristic approach, has been successfully applied to evolve scheduling heuristics for JSS due to its flexible representation. However, the simulation-based evaluation is computationally expensive since there are many calculations based on individuals for making decisions in the simulation. To improve training efficiency, this article proposes a novel multifidelity-based surrogate-assisted GP. Specifically, multifidelity-based surrogate models are first designed by simplifying the problem expected to be solved. In addition, this article proposes an effective collaboration mechanism with knowledge transfer for utilizing the advantages of multifidelity-based surrogate models to solve the desired problems. This article examines the proposed algorithm in six different scenarios. The results show that the proposed algorithm can dramatically reduce the computational cost of GP without sacrificing the performance in all scenarios.

Among these services, the Prognostic and Health Management (PHM) contributes to the health assessment of the manufacturing resources and to prognose their future conditions by providing decision supports for production and predictive maintenance management. However, the future conditions of technical production resources depend on the productive tasks they will have to carry out. If their future conditions will not satisfy production criteria, maintenance tasks will have to be planned and productive tasks will be delayed or assigned to other resources for which their future conditions considering these new tasks must be assessed. In this context, a multi-agent system SCEMP (Supervisor, Customers, Environment, Maintainers and Producers) is here proposed in which production scheduling and predictive maintenance planning collaborate and exploit decision supports provided by PHM modules. The proposed multi-agent system provides a framework in which production and the predictive maintenance activities can be scheduled simultaneously by compromising on their objectives. During the scheduling process, SCEMP enables to identify the needed predictive maintenance from the assignments of production tasks to machines, the machine component prognoses and machine models. It schedules production tasks and predictive maintenance activities according to the number, competencies and availabilities of production and maintenance resources. The SCEMP framework is described and presented in the tough job shop context. For this context, case studies have been generated and scheduled within acceptable computation times. To illustrate the SCEMP functioning, some case studies are detailed with the obtained performances. It is flexible and can be adapted to various manufacturing situations. It can also be used to assess the interest of implementing prognostic functions for machine components. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Multi-agent systems; Predictive maintenance; Prognostics and health management; Scheduling problem","Health; Job shop scheduling; Machine components; Maintenance; Manufacture; Production control; Case-studies; Condition; Customer environment; Decision supports; Joint scheduling; Maintenance activity; Predictive maintenance; Production resources; Prognostic and health management; Scheduling problem; Multi agent systems","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85136503313"

SMs are in charge of the automatic generation of decisions, and workers have the power to revise unreliable decisions. Furthermore, a threshold-based handover mechanism is proposed to determine when workers are involved in decision-making. Firstly, a measurement method is developed to quantify the confidence level of SM decisions. Secondly, an evaluation method is presented to determine the threshold of confidence levels, which can be used to discriminate whether the SM decisions are acceptable or not at a certain confidence level. Finally, several experiments are conducted in a smart workshop. The results show that the HMCDM/C can effectively coordinate workers with different experience levels and SMs, and has a very competitive performance. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Confidence levels; Dynamic scheduling; Human-machine collaboration; Smart workshops","Job shop scheduling; Production control; Collaboration; Conference; Confidence levels; Decisions makings; Dynamic scheduling; Hand over; Human-machine collaboration; Job-Shop scheduling; Smart workshop; Decision making","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85133711485"

This study considered the RMG (ready-made garment) industries in Bangladesh, which are mostly labor-intensive, as a case. Different types of manufacturing flexibility and environmental uncertainty were identified through a deductive approach from the existing literature and theory. Then, final sorting was con-ducted through a focus group discussion using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) techniques. This study revealed that demand, competitor, supplier, and technology uncertainty were ranked sequentially from first to fourth. This study also revealed that demand and competitor uncertainty would be the first-line focus, and supplier uncertainty the second-line focus, of decision makers. Similarly, new product, volume, work-force, and modification flexibility were ranked sequentially from first to fourth, and these would be considered first-line focuses by decision makers. This study also showed that all types of environmental uncertainties had an internal effect (one type affects another type within the types of environmental uncertainty). Internal effects among the different types of manufacturing flexibility were also identified. This study contributes to the theory of manufacturing flexibility for labor-intensive industries and will help decision makers gradually implement manufacturing flexibility based on their capacity and goal. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","analytical hierarchy process; decision making trial and evaluation laboratory; environmental uncertainty; focus group discussion; labor-intensive industry; manufacturing flexibility; ready-made garment industries","","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131054526"

With Industry 4.0 emerges a strong demand for data processing in the edge, constrained primarily by the limited available resources. In industry, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is increasingly used in robotics, job shop scheduling and supply chain. In this work, DRL is applied for intelligent resource allocation for industrial edge devices. An optimal usage of available resources of the IIoT devices should be achieved. Due to the structure of IIoT systems as well as security aspects, multi-agent systems (MASs) are preferred for decentralized decision-making. In our study, we build a network from physical and virtualized representative IIoT devices. The proposed approach is capable of dealing with several dynamic changes of the target system. Three aspects are considered when evaluating the performance of the MASs: overhead due to the MASs, improvement of the resource usage of the devices as well as latency and error rate. In summary, the agents’ resource usage with respect to traffic, computing resources and time is very low. It was confirmed that the agents not only achieve the desired results in training but also that the learned behavior is transferable to a real system. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","deep reinforcement learning; dynamic network; Industrial Internet of Things; load balancing; multi-agent system; resource allocation","Data handling; Decision making; Deep learning; Internet of things; Job shop scheduling; Reinforcement learning; Resource allocation; Supply chains; Communication resources; Computational resources; Dynamic network; Intelligent resource; Job-Shop scheduling; Limited communication; Load-Balancing; Resource usage; Resources allocation; Strong demand; Multi agent systems","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130776566"

However, for the increasingly complex production systems, operational decision making encounters more challenges in terms of having sustainable manufacturing to satisfy customers and markets’ rapidly changing demands. Nowadays, rule-based heuristic approaches are widely used for scheduling management in production systems, which, however, significantly depends on the expert domain knowledge. In this way, the efficiency of decision making could not be guaranteed nor meet the dynamic scheduling requirement in the job-shop manufacturing environment.

To address these real-life challenges, the model integrates the supply portfolio into production scheduling with a customer-imposed delivery time window. A set of conflicting factors is considered for the SC in which the manufacturer is modeled using the flexible job shop (FJS) problem to include greater flexibility in process routing. Since the proposed SCS model extends the strongly NP-hard FJS problem, two new meta-heuristic algorithms are developed, enhancing the performance of the multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO). A Tabu search inspired search mechanism and a problem-specific mutation operator are designed in both algorithms. As inadequate archive diversity leads to premature convergence and unsatisfactory Pareto solutions in many cases, this work employs two practical approaches separately (i.e., crowding distance (CD) and niche count preservation of reference point (RP)) in the proposed MOPSOs, called CD-MOPSO and RP-MOPSO, respectively. For leader selection, CD-MOPSO uses the swarm distance-based Roulette wheel, whereas the concept of RP is proposed in RP-MOPSO to expedite convergence. The performances of the proposed algorithms are validated against four existing algorithms and assessed by utilizing several criteria after solving 45 artificial instances. The simulation results and statistical analysis demonstrate the supremacy of the RP-MOPSO which increases the flexibility for a decision-maker in providing a higher number of Pareto solutions and more diverse and regular frontiers within reasonable computational time.

To pursue the same, Industry 4.0 technological aspects were recognized as solution measures to overcome the challenges for CE implementation in SC. Design methodology approach: A new hierarchical framework containing 13 leading CE challenges and eight promising Industry 4.0 technological aspects had been proposed, representing their mutual relationship. The proposed framework was analysed using a hybrid approach of analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and combinative distance-based assessment (CODAS) under interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy (IVIF) environment. The IVIF-AHP was used to acquire the priority weights of the CE challenges, whereas the IVIF-CODAS was used to attain the preference order of the proposed technological aspects. Findings: The key findings of the present work indicate that “Information disruptions among the SC members due to multiple channels” and “Manpower inability to handle the toxic materials” are the two most critical challenges hindering the adoption of CE practices in SC. Along with, the results also demonstrate that to overcome these challenges, “Smarter equipment to empower flexibility and mass customization” and “Big data driven decision-making system” are the two most significant Industry 4.0 technological solutions, adoption of which might encourage the organizations to align their operations with CE philosophies. Research limitations implications: The sample size of the experts engaged in work was limited; however, big data studies could be conducted in future to capture more insights of the stated topic. In addition to this, to understand the implication of CE on Industry 4.0-based manufacturing, a separate study can be synthesised in future. Originality value: The proposed work facilitates a new framework consolidating various perspectives associated with CE implementation into a manufacturing industry considering the scenario of Indian rubber industry.

Therefore, this paper proposes using discrete- event simulation (DES) to assist the decision-making process (DMP) for implementing a new automation technology within a production cell and showcase key performance indicator (KPI) identification using simulation. Two modeling scenarios were designed and contrasted to showcase implementing automation. One consists of a manually operated assembly line, and the other represents a semi- automated assembly line of the same process but with robots in specific areas of the production line. The results indicate that the comparative study between the two scenarios of a manually operated assembly cell and a semi-automated one can provide valuable insights into the DMP. The proposed approach has shown several influencing factors to consider in the DMP. The choice of prioritizing which element should have precedence depends on the requirement specifics. The insights from the study also indicate the requirement of further research in this context, considering different parameters apart from the current research and understanding their influence on the DMP.

One of the main reasons is the increased number of variables, parameters, and interrelations on the shop floor. This intrinsic complexity can grow exponentially when considering the manufacture of large-size products with high levels of variability and variants: the mass production of large recreational motorboats with high levels of customization and low production volumes, mass customization. With the increasing role of sustainability and concepts of Industry 5.0, focusing not just on improving production systems but also human wellbeing, quick decision making becomes essential. Data and digitalization are becoming the cornerstone for system improvement, and digital data availability and analysis can facilitate the utilization of computerized tools to support decision making and maximize the performance of complex systems. For that purpose, simulation can be a powerful analytical tool to design, maintain, and improve complex manufacturing systems. Simulation techniques usually allow handling the size and complexity commonly associated with manufacturing systems. However, in systems with highly customized and large-size products, manual processes, and limited floor space, the implementation of simulation techniques is not straightforward, especially considering the aspects of variability, data collection, model validation, and system reconfiguration. With a particular focus on large-size products and limitations of a constrained existing facility layout, this paper presents the implementation of a simulation-based reconfiguration assessment considering manual production, assembly, and internal logistics requirements. Going through an industrial case study of large recreational motorboats manufacturing, the paper analyses the system analysis, data collection, implementation, and validation of the methodology step by step. Considering different what-if scenarios, the focus is on the capacity reconfiguration using Discrete-Event Simulation.

To satisfy customers today mass customization is increasingly in need, requiring delicate modular architectures, both in product designs and production. Emerging is also the digitalized co-platforming era of automating the synchronization of product and production platforms. Yet, in all these processes, humans as agents have different roles, objectives, and mental models that governs their decision-making, being the bearer of separate ideas on what to optimize from their end. In product development large sensitivity is given to customer demands and trends to design attractive products, while less attention may be placed on evaluating the increase of variation into the production flows from new products, potentially increasing the workload and complexity of assembly systems, as well as, the subsequent material logistics. In production, much effort is invested to increase standardization, increase the pace, and minimize the manufacturing cost, with the objective to minimize required changes to the current production system. Consequently, it is a hard problem to satisfy all criteria at once, and how to solve it has no clear answer. Therefore, this study has applied qualitative System Dynamics modelling, also often referred to as systems thinking, to investigate how these opposing views were represented at an industrialized house builder.

This paper establishes a dual-channel supply chain composed of one manufacturer and one retailer under mass customization. The manufacturer sells standard products offline via the retailer when providing modular customized products online. Two online distribution strategies of the manufacturer are considered: The manufacturer can choose direct or agency sales through the retailer's online channel. Additionally, the return policy of modular customized products available online is explored. A Stackelberg game model is proposed under each return scenario (with and without online consumer returns) to derive the optimal solutions for different channel strategies. Then, the influence of different parameters on the optimal modularity level and product prices is investigated under each model. Through sensitivity analysis, we found that the cross-price sensitivity coefficient of dual channels has a considerably positive impact on optimal decisions. Furthermore, the manufacturer's channel strategy and return policy decisions are examined. The result indicates that direct sales should be chosen if manufacturers’ online channel operating costs are lower than a certain threshold that increases with the revenue allocation ratio under agency sales. When the market demand of the product that is allowed to be returned is much more sensitive to the refund than its return quantity, a full refund policy should be offered for online customized products. These conclusions also apply to the return scenario where full refunds are provided for both standard and customized products. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dual-channel; Mass customization; Modularity level; Online distribution strategies; Return policy","Computer aided manufacturing; Electronic commerce; Operating costs; Sensitivity analysis; Supply chains; Customized products; Distribution strategies; Dual channel; Dual-channel supply chains; Mass customization; Modularity level; Online distribution strategy; Optimal decisions; Return policy; Standard products; Sales; decision making; optimization; price dynamics; sensitivity analysis; supply chain management","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126591809"

At the same time, the real manufacturing system is prone to various disturbance events, which increase the complexity and uncertainty of shop floor. To this end, this paper addresses the dynamic flexible job shop scheduling problem with insufficient transportation resources (DFJSP-ITR) to minimize the makespan and total energy consumption. As a sequential decision-making problem, DFJSP-ITR can be modeled as a Markov decision process where the agent should determine the scheduling object and allocation of resources at each decision point. So this paper adopts deep reinforcement learning to solve DFJSP-ITR. In this paper, the multiobjective optimization model of DFJSP-ITR is established. Then, in order to make agent learn to choose the appropriate rule based on the production state at each decision point, a hybrid deep Q network (HDQN) is developed for this problem, which combines deep Q network with three extensions. Moreover, the shop floor state model is established at first, and then the decision point, generic state features, genetic-programming-based action space and reward function are designed. Based on these contents, the training method using HDQN and the strategy for facing new job insertions and machine breakdowns are proposed.

Low-volume-high-mix orders contain various design specifications that bring a large number of uncertainties to manufacturing systems. Traditional scheduling methods are limited in handling diverse manufacturing resources in a dynamic environment. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) arouses the interests of researchers in solving dynamic scheduling problems. However, it is difficult to optimize the scheduling policies for online decision making while considering multiple objectives. Therefore, this paper proposes a smart scheduler to handle real-time jobs and unexpected events in smart manufacturing factories. New composite reward functions are formulated to improve the decision-making abilities and learning efficiency of the smart scheduler. Based on deep reinforcement learning (RL), the smart scheduler autonomously learns to schedule manufacturing resources in real time and improve its decision-making abilities dynamically. We evaluate and validate the proposed scheduling model with a series of experiments on a smart factory testbed. Experimental results show that the smart scheduler not only achieves good learning and scheduling performances by optimizing the composite reward functions, but also copes with unexpected events (e.g. urgent or simultaneous orders, machine failures) and balances between efficiency and profits. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","composite reward; Job shop; multi-objective optimization; online scheduling; reinforcement learning","","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85127046224"

These capabilities, of data acquisition and robotics, are provided by Industry 4.0 Technologies. However, to take full advantage of those capabilities, it is imperative to have efficient decision-making processes to deliver adequate corrective actions. In this sense, we propose an event-driven rescheduling approach. This approach consists of an architecture that integrates information acquisition, optimization process, and rescheduling planning. We study the performance of the system with several algorithms with two performance criteria, namely, (i) relative performance deviation (RPD) in terms of objective function and (ii) schedule stability. We also propose a hybrid policy that combines full rescheduling regeneration with stability-oriented strategies aimed to balance both criteria. We conducted extensive computational tests with instances from the literature under different scenarios.

The fundamental scheduling problem is that all jobs need to be processed on the same route, which is called flow shop scheduling problems (FSSP). The goal of FSSP, proven as an NP-hard problem, is to find a job sequence that minimizes the makespan. In this paper, an improved Q-learning algorithm is proposed for solving the FSSP. Firstly, a problem model based on the basic Q-learning algorithm is constructed. The makespan is used as the feedback signal, and the process of environmental state change is defined as the process of job selection. Q-learning gives the expected utility of taking a given action in a given state. Afterwards, combined with the NEH heuristic, the algorithm efficiency is enhanced by changing the job inserting mode. In order to validate the proposed method, several simulation experiments are carried out on a set of test problems having different scales. The obtained optimization results of the proposed algorithm are compared to the standard Q-learning algorithm and a hybrid algorithm. The discussion and analysis show that the proposed algorithm performs better than the others in solving the permutation FSSP. As a future direction, in order to shorten the running time, further improvements will be studied to increase the performance of the proposed algorithm and make it applicable and efficient for solving multi-objective optimization problems. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","decision making; flow shop scheduling; learning (artificial intelligence); scheduling","Job shop scheduling; Machine shop practice; Multiobjective optimization; NP-hard; Reinforcement learning; Scheduling; Algorithm efficiency; Environmental state; Flow shop scheduling problem; Multi-objective optimization problem; Performance targets; Permutation flow-shop scheduling; Q-learning algorithms; Scheduling problem; Learning algorithms","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115255733"

Due to the advantages of simplicity, efficiency and quick response, heuristic rules have become the most promising technology to solve such problems. However, they suffer some drawbacks, such as high development and maintenance costs, low solution quality, and excessive emphasis on local information. To design heuristics from the perspective of system optimization and ensure the performance of heuristics in real-time production scheduling environments, this study develops a network-based dynamic dispatching rule generation mechanism. The complex network theory is introduced to extract a series of low-level heuristics from the perspective of system optimization, while the automatic heuristic generation problem is formulated as a multiple attribute decision making problem. Given that the dispersity of local features indicates their value for decision-making, the entropy weighting method is employed to automatically produce an adequate combination of the provided easy-to-implement low-level heuristics. Finally, the open shop scheduling problem with dynamic job arrivals is taken as an example to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Findings reported in the literature points to the benefits of integrating simulation-based tools with traditional lean value stream mapping in a hybrid framework to validate the feasibility of a given improvement. The main criteria are to reduce lean waste, increase productivity, and dynamically optimize manufacturing trade-offs for push–pull and just-in-time production systems by enhancing the efficacy of lean value stream mapping using a simulation-based approach.

This study investigates the potential of machine learning tools to predict the feasibility of a production plan. Production schedules are often not able to adhere to the production plans because production plans are built without accounting for all the detailed requirements that arise at the scheduling level.

Thanks to its promise to produce spare parts with shorter lead times, AM may enable a make-to-order rather than a make-to-stock manufacturing process. Using AM, in fact, would allow to reduce the high inventory levels that are required by conventional manufacturing (CM) techniques to cope with spare parts' intermittent demand. However, AM is characterized by two main drawbacks, i.e. first high production costs and second uncertain failure rates (often these uncertainties are higher than those of CM counterparts since AM is a manufacturing technique that is still subjected to substantial technological developments, while CM techniques are very well-established). While the former limitation can be counterbalanced with lower inventory costs, the latter remains an open issue, so far barely investigated. To the best of our knowledge, although researchers have considered the impact of failure rate uncertainties on the inventory costs and the total costs of spare parts management, no one has investigated how the failure rate uncertainty would affect the final decision on whether to manufacture spare parts in AM or CM. In this work, we aim to do so. Specifically, to make the analysis accurate and reliable, we have used realistic values of the failure rate uncertainties of AM and CM parts, obtained through a material science approach. From our results, which represents just a preliminary analysis where we have considered 40 different scenarios characterized by different combinations of spare part demands and backorder costs, we have observed that the failure rate uncertainty limits the conveniency of AM as sourcing option to only 7.5% of the analyzed scenarios (when the failure rate was considered too be known precisely, AM was the most convenient option 42.5% of the analyzed scenarios). These preliminary results indicate the need to reduce AM failure rate uncertainties to leverage the potential of AM for spare parts supply chains. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Additive Manufacturing (AM); Conventional Manufacturing (CM); Decision Support System; Decision Tree; Failure Rate Uncertainty; Spare Parts","3D printers; Additives; Artificial intelligence; Cost benefit analysis; Decision trees; Failure rate; Supply chains; Uncertainty analysis; Additive manufacturing; Conventional manufacturing; Failure rate uncertainties; Inventory costs; Manufacturing IS; Manufacturing techniques; Spare parts; Spare parts supply; Decision support systems","Conference paper","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144557207"

However, this approach neglects the reciprocal effects between the two decision-making outcomes, i.e., the impact of line feeding decisions on task times and the impact of balancing decisions on feeding requirements and constraints. This interaction is of peculiar interest for assembly lines in a mass-customization environment due to the large number of assembly tasks and parts.

Module production is one of the ways to achieve mass customization, and products are produced by combining modules. In the module production, it becomes much more important for manufacturing companies to reflect customers' preferences for selling products. The manufacturer can increase its total profit by providing customized products that satisfy customers' preferences by increasing customers' satisfaction. In conventional production planning, there are some cases where module production is conducted by the demands from customers' preferences. However, the customer decision-making model has not been employed in the production planning model. In this paper, a production planning model incorporating customers' preferences is developed. The customers' purchasing behavior is generated by using a machine learning model. Customer segmentation is conducted by clustering data that uses the purchase data of multiple customers. The resulting production planning model is a bilevel production planning problem consisting of a single company and multiple customers. Each company can sell products that combine modules that customers require in each segment. We show that the proposed model can obtain higher customers' satisfaction with greater profits than the model that does not employ the customers' purchasing model. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Customer's modeling; Machine learning; Mass customization; Production planning; Supply chain management","Computer aided manufacturing; Decision making; Machine learning; Planning; Production control; Production efficiency; Profitability; Sales; Supply chain management; Bilevel; Customer preferences; Customer-modeling; Customers' satisfaction; Machine-learning; Mass customization; Module production; Planning models; Production Planning; Production system; Customer satisfaction","Conference paper","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142860660"

In addition, human operators still play a pivotal role in particular for scenarios in which automation is not feasible or economically viable. Therefore, consistent decision-making processes are needed to reinforce in-plant performances at targeted levels. In this scenario, traditional tools of analysis are no more adequate to monitor such complex and variable environments. Recently, different digital technologies have been developed to acquire insightful and structured datasets of manufacturing processes. Among them, indoor positioning systems have gained interest due to their ability to accurately track any tagged moving asset within a certain coverage area. This paper proposes an original hardware and software architecture to autonomously and quantitatively monitor labor intensive job shops. The hardware consists in an Ultrawide-band based indoor positioning system, where tags are assigned to workers. The software counterpart leverages the acquired spatial and temporal data to enhance the visibility of production processes into different levels. On one hand, an automatically evaluated from to chart defines the rate of dependency among the geofenced areas of the job shop. Times spent within the storage areas are computed to evaluate the impact of replenishment routes for each worker. On the other hand, a Gantt chart displays times spent in each area along with the visiting sequence. By selecting a time interval equal to the cycle time of the job shop is possible to visualize how working times are divided into the different areas. From these valuable outputs, a re-layout of the entire job shop may be suggested and identified to increase the productivity of the process. The consistency and the resilience of this digital architecture is tested in a real manufacturing job shop which performs manual and automatic machining for the automotive industry. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","human factor; in-plant performances; Indoor positioning systems; manual processes; manufacturing re-layout","","Conference paper","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142809999"

This study focused on a PC approach that includes optional, redundant, and common modules. In this approach, three objective functions were considered and solved using NSGA-II: warranty profit, performance-price, and environmental emissions. Warranty profit is calculated by forcing the product failure probability to satisfy a power-law distribution and the user selection behavior to satisfy a multinomial logit (MNL) model. Kano’s model-based user satisfaction and the relative importance of the product module instance are used to calculate performance-price. The environmental emissions were determined from both production and assembly emissions of the module instance.

One of the reasons for the suboptimal adoption of hyperautomation is the large gap between current theoretical frameworks and practical methodologies and tools that can be applied in a real industrial production scenario. This situation has become much more complicated in high-tech enterprises, which face a particular set of issues in terms of innovation, cost-effectiveness, and supply chain management in today's globalized environment. This manuscript provides a new conceptual business framework and technological background for achieving sustainable hyperautomation in the manufacturing of linear electromechanical actuators (LEMA), a key component of several cyberphysical actuators. A set of digital tools and innovative concepts, such as intra-enterprise 3-level factory and definitive designs based on unified solutions, which enable mass customization and offer up to 1000 variants of the LEMAs, are introduced to achieve synergistic interaction between different business functions and provide significant cost and technological advantages. To make manufacturing more customizable, a modular design approach is used, and simultaneously, to facilitate mass production, the focus is given on roller screw transmission modules, representing approximately three-fourths of the added value of LEMA. Furthermore, the concept of synergetic forward integration is proposed and explained using an example of robotic resistance spot welding. This framework involves a closed loop of industrial mature digital tools that enables autonomous product design and manufacturing via Responsive R&D (Research and Development) and feedback-driven dynamic interactions with the market and production system.

As car production demand diversifies, manufacturing processes require high flexibility. An alternative to a conventional production line, matrix-structured production system provides a flexible manufacturing environment. In this system, until the final assembly operation is completed, each autonomous mobile robot (AMR) is assigned to a single car body and transports among various workstations to accomplish its given operations. These operations require sequential procedure and can be performed at multiple workstations. Therefore, assigning AMRs to appropriate workstations and operations is the key decision making that determines the capacity of the plants. In this paper, we formulate the Markov decision process (MDP) model for the flexible job shop scheduling problem with a single AMR and get the optimal policy by applying dynamic programming.

One of the key aspects of these systems is a production planning, specifically, Scheduling operations on the machines. To cope with this problem, this paper proposed a Deep Reinforcement Learning with an Actor-Critic algorithm (DRLAC). We model the Job-Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), represent the state of a JSSP as simple Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN) to extract nodes features during scheduling, and derive the policy of optimal scheduling which guides the included node features to the best next action of schedule. In addition, we adopt the Actor-Critic (AC) network’s training algorithm-based reinforcement learning for achieving the optimal policy of the scheduling. To prove the proposed model’s effectiveness, first, we will present a case study that illustrated a conflict between two job scheduling, secondly, we will apply the proposed model to a known benchmark dataset and compare the results with the traditional scheduling methods and trending approaches.

The common practice in solving this problem is to first identify capacity levels and then determine patient scheduling decisions separately, which typically leads to suboptimal decisions that often result in ineffective outcomes of care. In order to overcome these inefficiencies, in this paper, we propose a novel two-stage stochastic optimization model that integrates these two decisions, which can lower costs by exploring the coupling relationship between patient scheduling and capacity configuration. The patient scheduling problem is modeled as a Markov decision process. We first analyze the properties for the multitype patient case under specific assumptions and then establish structural properties of the optimal scheduling policy for the one-type patient case. Based on these findings, we propose optimal solution algorithms to solve the joint optimization problem for this special case. Because it is intractable to solve the original two-stage problem for a general multitype system with large state space, we propose a heuristic policy and a two-stage stochastic mixed-integer programming model solved by the Benders decomposition algorithm, which is further improved by combining an approximate linear program and the look-ahead strategy. To illustrate the efficiency of our approaches and draw managerial insights, we apply our solutions to a data set from the day surgery center of a large public hospital in Shanghai, China. The results show that the joint optimization of capacity planning and patient scheduling could significantly improve the performance. Furthermore, our model can be applied to a rolling-horizon framework to optimize dynamic patient scheduling decisions. Through extensive numerical analyses, we demonstrate that our approaches yield good performances, as measured by the gap against an upper bound, and that these approaches outperform several benchmark policies. Summary of Contribution: First, this paper investigates the joint optimization problem of multiresource capacity planning and multitype patient scheduling under uncertain demands and random capacity consumption, which poses a significant computational challenge. It belongs to the scope of computing and operations research. Second, this paper formulates a mathematical model, establishes optimality properties, proposes solution algorithms, and performs extensive numerical experiments using real-world data. This work includes aspects of dynamic stochastic control, computing algorithms, and experiments. Moreover, this paper is motivated by a practical problem (joint management of capacity planning and patient scheduling in the day surgery center) in our cooperative hospital, which is also key to numerous other applications, for example, the make-to-order manufacturing systems and computing facility systems. By using the optimality properties, solution algorithms, and management insights derived in this paper, the practitioners can be equipped with a decision support tool for efficient and effective operation decisions. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","approximate linear program; capacity planning; Markov decision process; patient scheduling; two-stage stochastic optimization","Hospitals; Integer programming; Linear programming; Markov processes; Operations research; Stochastic models; Stochastic programming; Stochastic systems; Surgery; Approximate linear program; Capacity planning; Joint optimization; Linear programs; Markov Decision Processes; Multi-resource; Multitype; Patient scheduling; Stochastic optimizations; Two-stage stochastic optimization; Scheduling","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85134615218"

A time-efficient and automated planning method is especially important as shortened product lifecycles, changing technologies, and market requirements lead to changes in the production program, which further require the re-planning of the factory layout. Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven to be a suitable approach to support decision-making in complex layout planning problems. However, recent studies only consider comparably small and exemplary problem statements with a maximum of 4 functional units. In consequence, these approaches are insufficient for industrial applications in which numerous functional units are considered. Regarding this background, this paper investigates the scalability of a RL-based planning approach, in which a Double Deep Q Learning agent is used to solve a layout planning task for a small batch production with 20 functional units. Considering that recent approaches lack scalability, this paper presents a new state representation in combination with an action masking method that optimizes the action selection process to ensure the scalability of the approach and reduce the training time. After the training, the algorithm can generate an optimized factory layout by reducing the resulting transportation time for industrial relevant problem sizes. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Factory planning; Layout planning; Machine learning; Optimization; Reinforcement learning","Decision making; Deep learning; Life cycle; Scalability; Automated planning; Efficient planning; Factory planning; Functional units; Layout planning; Machine-learning; Optimisations; Q-learning; Reinforcement learnings; Time-efficient; Reinforcement learning","Conference paper","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132306952"

Job shop environments could be mentioned as an example where decision makers are try to schedule all jobs in such a way that tardy jobs (TJ) are minimized. Indeed, manufacturers are received customers’ orders and required to deliver them no later than the determined due dates. Otherwise, penalties should be paid to customers and it can lead to a huge amount of financial loss. Also, regarding global warming and climate changes manufacturers should redesign their processes from an eco-friendly perspective. Motivated by these issues, in this paper, a green bi-objective model has been formulated to solve the problem of scheduling parallel machines considering TJ and job splitting property (JSP). In the proposed model, the first objective function minimizes the total number of TJ while the second objective function is minimization of total energy consumption. An augmented ε-constraint method has been deployed for solving small-scale problems. However, to solve large-scale problems, an efficient Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm has been developed while a Harmony Search (HS) algorithm has also been applied to examine the quality of the proposed SA algorithm.

The scheduling problem aims to increase productivity and reduce energy consumption via a mathematical model. With this paper, an effective genetic algorithm is proposed for MO-FJSP based on maximum completion time, total machine load, and bottleneck machine load. The solution method utilizes a hybrid multiobjective genetic algorithm. A combination of global selection and fast selection is used for initialization and obtaining a uniformly distributed initial population. The cross-variance operator is adaptively improved to enhance the searching in the population. Following that an elite retention mechanism is designed to address the possible limitations of the elite strategy in maintaining population diversity. As a result, an improved harmonic search algorithm is introduced to improve the quality of individuals in the elite pool. The proposed hybrid method is implemented in MATLAB R2018a. Tests were conducted using the benchmark Kacem test set, the BR data data set, and with the actual production cases. The algorithm succeeded in achieving 13 nondominated solutions in the initial 20 runs. Moreover, the method obtains the optimal value criterion for the solution accuracy factor. As a whole, results of the evaluation testify that the proposed method can be used to solve the MO-FJSP with high accuracy and fast convergence. The method also provides feasible and effective scheduling solutions for the decision-makers in actual production. Based on the promising results obtained, it is deduced that the method has a wide applicability range particularly in manufacturing sector. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Decision making; Energy utilization; Job shop scheduling; Manufacture; Statistical tests; Bottleneck machines; Completion time; Energy; Flexible job-shop scheduling problem; Manufacturing sector; Multi objective; Problem-based; Reduce energy consumption; Scheduling problem; Total machine loads; Genetic algorithms","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128170545"

Its dangerous characteristics will not decrease with time, but will exist for a long. The environmental risks of hazardous waste landfills are concentrated in the probability risk of leakage of the impermeable layer. Therefore, it is of great significance to calculate the environmental risk of the leakage source intensity of typical hazardous waste landfills. In order to adapt to the personalized customer needs caused by social and economic development and to pursue new competitive advantages, the production mode of manufacturing enterprises is gradually changing to a small-batch and multi-variety customized mode. The complex and dynamic production environment caused by determinism puts forward higher requirements for the operation control accuracy of large-scale multiunit production systems. To support the efficient and coordinated operation of each link is a key challenge for process control of large-scale multiunit production logistics systems. This article proposes to accelerate the integration of information technology and manufacturing technology to promote the application of intelligent manufacturing process, intelligent logistics management, and other technologies in the production process. The research object is to study the multiunit linkage optimization problem under the framework of digital twin technology, through the real-time collaborative decision-making and feedback execution of the production, transportation, and warehousing multi-decision links to solve the ""production-transportation-storage""decision-making in a dynamic environment. We analyzed the problems brought about by the dynamic interference of the execution process on the ""production-transportation-storage""linkage operation process of the industrial park and analyzed the challenges of realizing the online linkage decision-making of ""production-transportation-storage.""Based on the classic digital twin framework, a cross-unit digital twin linkage decision information architecture is proposed.

The environmental protection measures of this project are relatively complete, which can meet various environmental protection requirements and enterprise development needs during the operation period of the project.

One of the key decisions of production enterprises is production task allocation based on cloud robot cell-line, which determines the efficiency and flexibility of the production system and affects various production links, such as job-shop logistics, production planning, and production scheduling. This paper explores the production task allocation, from the angle of the optimal combination of cloud manufacturing resources. First, a mathematical model was established, based on the transport cost of different sub-tasks and the tardiness cost of product delivery, and solved by quantum firefly algorithm (QFA). Next, QFA was proved superior to traditional firefly algorithm (FA), improved FA, and the FA optimized by cat swarm optimization (CSO-FA), in terms of time complexity and spatial complexity.

It is very helpful to prevent costly equipment failures, and reduce significant production loss caused by unscheduled machine breakdown. Although important, decision models for joint predictive maintenance and production in manufacturing systems have not been fully explored. Therefore, we propose a reinforcement learning based decision model, that brings together production system modeling and approximate dynamic programming. We start from the development of a state-based model by analyzing the dynamics of a multistage production system with predictive maintenance. It provides an approach to quantitatively evaluate the various disruptions as well as the maintenance decision's impact on production. Then a reinforcement learning method is proposed to explore optimal maintenance policies, that optimize the production and maintenance cost. To further improve the performance of the production system, machine stoppage bottlenecks are defined. An event-based indicator is proved to identify bottlenecks with production data. We test the proposed models in simulation case studies. The proposed predictive maintenance decision model is compared with three policies, which are state-based policy (SBP), time-based policy (TBP) and greedy policy (GP). The numerical studies show that the proposed decision model outperforms the policies, and it has the lowest system cost that is 9.68%, 39.07%, and 39.56% lower than SBP, TBP, and GP, respectively. In addition, the research shows that bottleneck identification and mitigation could help manufacturing systems to achieve more than 9.00% throughput improvement. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","approximate dynamic programming; bottleneck; decision making; Markov chain model; predictive maintenance; Production system analysis","Costs; Dynamic programming; Industrial research; Life cycle; Maintenance; Manufacture; Markov processes; Reinforcement learning; Approximate dynamic programming; Bottleneck; Decision modeling; Decisions makings; Maintenance decisions; Markov chain models; Multi-stage production systems; Predictive maintenance; Production system; Production system analyse; Decision making","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85124743585"

Intelligent manufacturing consists in using supply chain data that are integrated for smart decision making during the production life cycle. This research, in cooperation with a large electric power transformer manufacturer, provides an overview of critical intelligent manufacturing (IM) technologies. An ontology schema forms the terminology relationships needed to build two intelligent supply chain management (SCM) modules for the IM system demonstration. The two core modules proposed in this research are the intelligent supplier selection and component ordering module and the product quality prediction module. The intelligent supplier selection and component ordering module dispatches orders that match the best options of suppliers based on combined analytic hierarchy process (AHP) analysis and multiobjective integer optimization. In the case study, the intelligent supplier selection and component ordering module demonstrates several acceptable Pareto solutions based on strict constraints, which is a very challenging task for decision makers without assistance. The second module is the product quality prediction module which uses multivariate regression and ARIMA to predict the quality of the finished products. Results show that the R square values are very close to 1. The module shortens the time for the company to accurately judge whether the two semifinished iron cores for the product meet the quality requirements.

Performance evaluation of the flexible job shop is carried out to minimize the Makespan, mean Flow-Time, mean Tardiness, and maximum Tardiness. Best performing CDRs and hybrid MCDM techniques are employed for minimizing the objectives considered in this study. The proposed solution framework integrates Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) for assigning weights to the criteria and MCDM approaches namely technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), The Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS), Compromise Programming (CP), and Weighted Average Method (WAM) separately to prioritize the jobs.

These platform-based flow lines explore common process routes while highlighting rebatching scheduling with selectivity banks (RBS) to handle large process varieties across production stages at minimum setup cost. Given the inherent coupling between decision making in job diverging and retrieval quality, an interactive optimization approach is necessary for the RBS problem. This study proposes a bilevel interactive optimization (BIO) model for RBS to accommodate high variety flow line production. The model addresses the conflicting goals of lane occupancy cost, process setup cost, and job divergence and retrieval efficiency. Regarding job divergence at the leader-level, a vehicle routeing problem with precedence constraints is formulated and solved by a constructed genetic algorithm (GA). Concerning job retrieval at the follower-level and the ongoing characteristic of selectivity banks, a dispatching problem with various batch size preference and dynamic time window is established and dealt with a restricted dynamic programming (RDP) algorithm after balancing search efficiency and accuracy. Thus, to solve the BIO, a hybrid GA-RDP is developed and implemented.

To produce feasible and industrially meaningful schedules, this paper extends the recently proposed batch-oblivious approach by considering unavailability periods and minimum time lags and by simultaneously optimizing multiple criteria that are relevant in the industrial context. A novel criterion on the satisfaction of production targets decided at a higher level is also proposed. Because the solution approach must be embedded in a real-time application, decision makers must express their preferences before the optimization phase. In addition, a preference model is introduced where trade-off is only allowed between some criteria. Two a priori multiobjective extensions of Simulated Annealing are proposed, which differ in how the simultaneous use of a lexicographic order and weights is handled when evaluating the fitness. A known a posteriori approach of the literature is used as a benchmark. All the metaheuristics are embedded in a Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure.

However, current research in this area does not sufficiently examine broader enterprise considerations, such as production and inventory management complexity and costs, or expected sales. Furthermore, very few existing platform design methods integrate fitting and ergonomic considerations in their formulation. This study proposes a two-stage platform-based design process to support apparel brands to implement mass customization (MC) strategies. This work has been conducted in collaboration with Yamamay, an Italian underwear and lingerie brand. In the first stage, the characteristics of a scale-based platform (i.e. the number of product variants) are determined based on (i) the results of the anthropometric analysis of a large Italian female population sample, (ii) business considerations discussed together with brand managers and experts, (iii) and benchmarking data. In the second stage, a novel and ad-hoc developed evolutionary-based decision aid model stretches and shrinks the resulting classes looking for the optimal trade-off based on anthropometric data between the demand of garments that fit well and the percentage of the population that is satisfied with the proposed product family. The approach proposed here has been proved effective not only in theory but also in practice through a pilot launch of a test product family. Integrating scale-based platform design of apparel with ergonomic, production, inventory, and sales considerations makes this study unique and paves the way for the implementation of customization-as-a-service business model and for the transformation of the fashion industry into a technology- and knowledge-intensive industry. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Decision support system; Fashion industry; Genetic algorithm; Industry 4.0; Mass customization; Product platform design","Anthropometry; Artificial intelligence; Computer aided manufacturing; Economic and social effects; Ergonomics; Genetic algorithms; Industry 4.0; Population statistics; Product design; Sales; Apparel products; Decision aids; Design and optimization; Fashion industry; Mass customization; Plat-form based products; Platform design; Product families; Product platform design; Product platforms; Decision support systems","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85117416860"

This process has attracted the interest of several companies involved in rapid prototyping, mass customisation and small-batch production. The components produced via Multi Jet Fusion can exhibit some characteristic defects depending on the part geometry and orientation, the process parameters and the environmental conditions. First of all, the most characteristic defects related to the process and their main causes are analysed. Five numerical descriptors are proposed to qualitatively predict the impact of these defects based on the digital representation of a part. Then, an intelligent system is developed to replicate the decision-making process of a human expert orienting parts before nesting. Particularly, a genetic algorithm-based approach is used to identify a pseudo-optimal part orientation under a set of objectives defined by the user. The fitness function is obtained as a weighted sum of the above-mentioned descriptors.

The new trend of mass customization brings a higher level of disturbances and uncertainties to production planning. Traditional manufacturing systems analyze data and schedule orders in a centralized architecture, which is inefficient and unreliable for the overdependence on central controllers and limited communication channels. Internet of things (IoT) and cloud technologies make it possible to build a distributed manufacturing architecture such as the multi-agent system (MAS). Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) methods are used to solve scheduling problems in the manufacturing setting. However, it is difficult for scheduling algorithms to process high-dimensional data in a distributed system with heterogeneous manufacturing units. Therefore, this paper presents new cyber-physical integration in smart factories for online scheduling of low-volume-high-mix orders. First, manufacturing units are interconnected with each other through the cyber-physical system (CPS) by IoT technologies. Attributes of machining operations are stored and transmitted by radio frequency identification (RFID) tags. Second, we propose an AI scheduler with novel neural networks for each unit (e.g., warehouse, machine) to schedule dynamic operations with real-time sensor data. Each AI scheduler can collaborate with other schedulers by learning from their scheduling experiences. Third, we design new reward functions to improve the decision-making abilities of multiple AI schedulers based on reinforcement learning (RL). The proposed methodology is evaluated and validated in a smart factory by real-world case studies. Experimental results show that the new architecture for smart factories not only improves the learning and scheduling efficiency of multiple AI schedulers but also effectively deals with unexpected events such as rush orders and machine failures. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Composite reward; Multi-agent system; Online scheduling; Reinforcement learning; Smart factory","Agricultural robots; Clustering algorithms; Cyber Physical System; Data warehouses; Decision making; Distributed database systems; E-learning; Embedded systems; Intelligent agents; Manufacture; Multi agent systems; Network architecture; Production control; Radio frequency identification (RFID); Reinforcement learning; Scheduling; Centralized architecture; Communication technologies; Cyber-physical systems (CPS); Distributed manufacturing; Internet of Things (IOT); Multi-agent reinforcement learning; Radio-frequency-identification tags (RFID); Traditional manufacturing; Internet of things","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85107792029"

More and more customers like customized products, which will bring challenges to the product line design and the production. If a company adopts customers' favorite levels, this may lead to lower product reliability, or incompatibility among the components that make up the product. Moreover, it is worth outsourcing certain attribute levels to reduce production cost, but customers may dislike these levels because of their delivery delay. If managers consider the compatibility issue, the quality issue, outsource determination, and the delivery due date in the product design and production stages, they will avoid unreasonable product configuration and many unnecessary expenses, thereby bringing benefits to the company. To solve this complicated problem, we establish a nonlinear program that maximizes Per-capita-contribution Margin considering Reliability Penalty. Since the integrated product line design and production problem is NP-hard, we propose an improved Discrete Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (DICA).

Design/methodology/approach: The research methodology involves multilevel dispatching rule generation, simulations, WGRA and result analysis. A complete permutation of multilevel dispatching rules, including the partial orders, is generated from five basic rules. Performance measures include cycle time, move, tool idling and queue time. The simulation model and data are obtained from a wafer fab in Malaysia. Two seasons varying in customer orders and objective weights are defined. Finally, to benchmark performance and investigate the effect of varying values of coefficient, the models are compared against TOPSIS and VIKOR. Findings: Results show that the seasons prefer different multilevel dispatching rules. In Normal season, the ideal first basic dispatching rule is critical ratio (CR) and CR followed by shortest processing time (SPT) is the best precedence pairing. In Peak season, the superiority of the rule no longer heavily relies on the first basic rule but rather depends on the combination of tiebreaker rules and on-time delivery (OTD) followed by CR is considered the best precedence pairing. Compared to VIKOR and TOPSIS, WGRA generates more stable rankings in this study. The performance of multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) methods is influenced by the data variability, as a higher variability produces a much consistent ranking. Research limitations/implications: As research implications, the application illustrates the effectiveness and practicality of the WGRA model in analyzing multilevel dispatching rules, considering the complexity of the semiconductor wafer fabrication system. The methodology is useful for researchers wishing to integrate MCDM model into multilevel dispatching rules. The limitation of the research is that the results were obtained from a simulation model. Also, the rules, criteria and weights assigned in WGRA were decided by the management. Lastly, the distinguishing coefficient is fixed at 0.5 and the effect to the ranking requires further study. Originality/value: The research is the first deployment WGRA in ranking multilevel dispatching rules. Multilevel dispatching rules are rarely studied in scheduling research although studies show that the tiebreakers affect the performances of the dispatching rules. The scheduling reflects the characteristics of wafer fabrication and general job shop, such as threshold and look-ahead policies. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Batching; Dispatching rule; Grey relational analysis; Scheduling; Semiconductor manufacturing","Benchmarking; Decision making; Fabrication; Job shop scheduling; Silicon wafers; Basic rules; Batching; Critical ratio; Dispatching rules; Grey relational analysis; Multilevels; Performance; Semiconductor manufacturing; Simulation model; Wafer fabrications; Semiconductor device manufacture","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85121836601"

A multi-objective optimization model is constructed to minimize the maximum worker fatigue and makespan. Furthermore, an enhanced NSGA-II (ENSGA) is developed in this paper to cope with the proposed problem. In the ENSGA, four dispatch rules are designed to generate high-quality solutions at the initialization stage. Two neighborhood structures based on a novel method of defining the critical path are designed to strengthen the ability of local search.

Clients are demanding increasingly more customised products at a more competitive cost, speed, and quality. Yet current design systems and existing literature largely overlook the use of automated decision-making tools for supporting mass-customisation for prefabricated buildings. To address this gap, a method for using automated tools to optimise the modularisation of prefabricated light-weight structures is investigated. This study's primary contributions include a multi-variable Modularisation Index, which offers a novel framework for characterising the “optimal” solution, and a recursive Slack-distribution algorithm, which offers a novel method for modularising customised architectural designs. The core insight is that an optimal modularisation solution may be found using a Greedy algorithm. This involves incrementally adjusting the internal module boundaries from the initial solution, and evaluating each viable solution using the proposed Modularisation Index. The Index considers functions of cost, speed, and quality that are weighted according to client preferences. The system outputs the top three highest scoring modularisation solutions which may then be examined by the builder. Overall, the proposed method performs equal to or better than experts for 90% of cases. The Index and modularisation algorithm hence offer useful tools for automating and optimising prefabricated construction, with further opportunity for optimising architectural designs. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Modularisation; Multi-variable index; Optimisation; Prefabrication; Slack","","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85106339920"

This increase in system dynamics imposes additional flexibility requirements especially on assembly processes, as complexity accumulates in this last step of value creation. Flexible and dynamically interconnected assembly systems can meet the increased requirements as opposed to traditional dedicated assembly line approaches. The high complexity and dynamical environment in these kinds of systems lead to the demand for real-time online control and scheduling solutions. Within the decision-making of online scheduling, the capability of predicting the consequences of available actions is crucial. In real-time environments, running extensive discrete-event simulations to evaluate how actions unfold requires too much computing time. Artificial neural networks (ANN) are a viable alternative to quickly evaluate the potential future performance value of a production state for online production planning and control. They can predict performance indicators such as the expected makespan given the current production status. Leveraging recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) game algorithms, an assembly control system based on Google DeepMind’s AlphaZero was created.

In this paper, a novel closed-loop scheduling framework is proposed to achieve real-time decision making by calling the appropriate data-driven dispatching rules at each rescheduling point. This framework contains four parts: offline training, online decision-making, data base and rules base. In the offline training part, the potential and appropriate dispatching rules with managers’ expectations are explored successfully by an improved gene expression program (IGEP) from the historical production data, not just the available or predictable information of the shop floor. In the online decision-making part, the intelligent shop floor will implement the scheduling scheme which is scheduled by the appropriate dispatching rules from rules base and store the production data into the data base. This approach is evaluated in a scenario of the intelligent job shop with random jobs arrival.

With the development of the advanced manufacturing technologies, as well as the national strategies, for example, Made in China 2025, real-time performance evaluation, prediction, production management, and efficient control of systems with flexible production mode are gradually becoming important issues. Under the assumption of assembly systems with small batch-based production tasks, we develop a mathematical model for the real-time performance analysis of such systems with the geometric machine reliability model, which is applicable in many manufacturing environments. The formulas for real-time performance analysis are derived first using the Markovian approach for three-machine assembly systems. Then, based on the idea of decomposition and aggregation, an algorithm with high accuracy and efficiency for system real-time performance approximation is proposed. Finally, the decomposition and aggregation-based real-time analysis approach is extended to the generalized assembly systems. Note to Practitioners - As the concept of manufacturing intelligence being proposed and promoted, system flexibility appears frequently in production in recent years. A flexible production refers to the implementation of small batch-based production with multitype of products on the same production line, by quick setup or machine adjustments. The steady-state analysis method that is traditionally used might be not applicable in this case since most of the production process is in transient state. An approximation-based analytical method, for real-time performance evaluation of assembly systems with small batch-based production tasks and with machines having the geometric reliability model, is proposed. The algorithm developed in this article can be utilized by production managers and engineers, with which the real-time performance of the systems can be predicted with high accuracy. It can also provide assistance for decision-making on activities of production control. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Assembly system; batch-based production; geometric reliability model; real-time analysis","Approximation algorithms; Assembly; Decision making; Geometry; Manufacture; Markov processes; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Production control; Reliability analysis; Riveting; Advanced manufacturing technologies; Decomposition and aggregation; Manufacturing environments; National strategies; Production management; Real time performance; Real time performance evaluation; Steady-state analysis; Real time systems","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85112685557"

Older workers are more vulnerable because of a possible decrease in physical capacities but can have a higher experience level. It is important to evaluate these factors during production process decisions and adapt the working environment to such workers. In such a way, production systems performance and workers’ well-being are jointly achieved. In companies aiming to include these aspects, digitalisation and automation can provide tools that can be used at tactical, strategic or operational levels. For example, at the operational level, wearable sensors, smart devices or trackers can be used in analysing the working time, effort and physical fatigue of operators via human-energy expenditure. These measures can be used to assess the required recovery time. However, the most challenging step is to include these measures in the decision-making process to organise the working process for operators according to their profiles and health restrictions. In this paper, we show how fatigue can be incorporated into operational processes such as scheduling in the context of a Dual-Resource Constrained (DRC) job shop. We consider several models to integrate rest allowance into the scheduling process and present a heuristic approach to assign operations to workers and machines.

Shop scheduling is a subsection of scheduling related to manufacturing shops. The job shop scheduling problem (JSP) aims to minimize the makespan of a product value of the production process. This issue is related to optimizing the sequence of the jobs on appropriate machines. With globalization, manufacturing shops are scattered around the world. The distributed job shop scheduling problem (DJSP) tries to solve the optimizing sequence on these scattered facilities. DJSP is more complex than JSP. DJSP is solved by exact and heuristic solvers. Exact solvers more time-consuming processes for huge problems. In this work, a discrete version of the spotted hyena optimizer (DSHO) is proposed for solving DJSP. A workload-based facility order mechanism and a greedy heuristic approach are combined with the DSHO algorithm. 80 distributed job shop scheduling problems (DJSP) are solved by DSHO. For evaluating the performance of the DSHO, numerical results of the 480 (2 facilities to 7 facilities) large instances that are derived from well-known JSP benchmarks are compared with four different discrete meta-heuristic algorithms. The experimental results are shown that DSHO is a pioneer solver for DJSP. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Discrete spotted hyena optimizer; Discrete swarm intelligence; Distributed job shop scheduling; Job shop scheduling; Spotted hyena optimizer","Benchmarking; Decision making; Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Machine shops; Manufacture; Optimization; Scheduling; Decision making process; Greedy heuristics; Job shop scheduling problems; Manufacturing companies; Meta heuristic algorithm; Numerical results; Ordering mechanism; Production process; Job shop scheduling","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103695362"

For a process to be smart, it is necessary to combine a given blend of data technologies, information and knowledge that enable it to perceive its environment and to autonomously perform actions that maximize its success possibilities in its assigned tasks. Of all the different ways leading to this transformation, both the generation of virtual replicas of processes and applying artificial intelligence (AI) techniques provide a wide range of possibilities whose exploration is today a far from negligible sources of opportunities to increase industrial companies' competitiveness. As a complex manufacturing process, production order scheduling in the job-shop is a necessary scenario to act by implementing these technologies. This research work considers an initial conceptual smart digital twin (SDT) framework for scheduling job-shop orders in a zero-defect manufacturing (ZDM) environment. The SDT virtually replicates the job-shop scheduling issue to simulate it and, based on the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methodology, trains a prescriber agent and a process monitor.

A multi-product and multi-period supply chain structure has been developed, including a factory, warehouses, and customers. Furthermore, the flexible job shop scheduling problem is integrated into the manufacturing part of the supply chain network to make the structure more comprehensive. In the proposed problem, each product includes a sequence of operations and is processed on a set of multi-functional machines at the factory to produce the final product. Final products are delivered to the warehouses to meet customers’ demands. If the demands of customers are not fulfilled, the shortage in the form of backorder may occur at any period. The problem is expressed as a bi-objective mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model. The first objective function is to minimize the total supply chain costs. On the other hand, the second objective function aims to minimize the makespan in all periods. A numerical example is presented to evaluate the performance of the proposed MILP model. Five multi-objective decision-making (MODM) methods, namely weighted sum, goal programming, goal attainment, LP metric, and max–min, are used to provide different alternative solutions to the decision-makers. The performance of the methods is evaluated according to both objective function values and CPU time criteria. In order to select the best solution technique, the displaced ideal solution method is applied.

First, we consider a newsvendor model in which an unbiased retailer sells mass customized products. The retailer needs to make order quantity decisions before the selling season. Meanwhile, the supplier is a mass customization manufacturer and implements modular production. The supply process is uncertain, as the real quantity the retailer received is the order quantity multiplied by a random yield rate. Second, two overconfident models are considered and theorems are proposed. In the first model, the behavioral bias of overconfidence only affects the retailer's judgment of variance of market demand. In the second model, the behavior bias of overconfidence affects not only the retailer's cognition of the variance of market demand, but also his cognition of the expectation of market demand. In addition, the relationship between the optimal decisions and the modularity level is obtained.

However, in the context of intelligent manufacturing, most studies apply the industrial internet of things (IIoT) to improve energy efficiency. It may cause the real-time data in the workshop unable to be collected and treated timely, thus affecting the real-time decision-making of the scheduling system. Edge computing (EC) can make full use of embedded computing capabilities of field devices to process real-time data and reduce the response time of making production decisions. Therefore, in this study, an overall architecture of the EC-IIoT based distributed and flexible job shop real-time scheduling (DFJS-RS) is proposed to enhance the real-time decision-making capability of the scheduling system. The DFJS-RS method, which consists of the task assignment method of the shop floor layer and the RS method of the flexible manufacturing units (FMUs) layer, is designed and developed. An evolutionary game-based solver method is adopted to obtain the optimal allocation. Finally, a case study is employed to validate the DFJS-RS method. The results show that compared with the existing production scheduling method, the DFJS-RS method can improve energy efficiency by up to 26%.

A new generation of smart factories is expected to support new multivariety and small-batch customized production modes. For this, artificial intelligence (AI) is enabling higher value-added manufacturing by accelerating the integration of manufacturing and information communication technologies, including computing, communication, and control. The characteristics of a customized smart factory are: self-perception, operations optimization, dynamic reconfiguration, and intelligent decision-making. The AI technologies will allow manufacturing systems to perceive the environment, adapt to the external needs, and extract the process knowledge, including business models, such as intelligent production, networked collaboration, and extended service models. This article focuses on the implementation of AI in customized manufacturing (CM). The architecture of an AI-driven customized smart factory is presented. Details of intelligent manufacturing devices, intelligent information interaction, and construction of a flexible manufacturing line are showcased. The state-of-the-art AI technologies of potential use in CM, that is, machine learning, multiagent systems, Internet of Things, big data, and cloud-edge computing, are surveyed. The AI-enabled technologies in a customized smart factory are validated with a case study of customized packaging. The experimental results have demonstrated that the AI-assisted CM offers the possibility of higher production flexibility and efficiency.

Different genetic programming (GP) methods have been developed for this task and achieved very encouraging results. However, these methods usually have trouble in discovering powerful and compact heuristics, especially for difficult problems. Moreover, there is no systematic approach for the decision makers to intervene and embed their knowledge and preferences in the evolutionary process. This article develops a novel people-centric evolutionary system for dynamic production scheduling. The two key components of the system are a new mapping technique to incrementally monitor the evolutionary process and a new adaptive surrogate model to improve the efficiency of GP. The experimental results with dynamic flexible job shop scheduling show that the proposed system outperforms the existing algorithms for evolving scheduling heuristics in terms of scheduling performance and heuristic sizes. The new system also allows the decision makers to interact on the fly and guide the evolution toward the desired solutions. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Diversity; flexible job shop scheduling; genetic programming (GP); visualization","Decision making; Genetic algorithms; Genetic programming; Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Job shop scheduling; Production control; Evolutionary process; Evolutionary system; Flexible job-shop scheduling; Mapping techniques; Production Scheduling; Scheduling decisions; Scheduling heuristics; Scheduling performance; Scheduling; article; heuristics; human","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101077722"

We propose a formulation-exploration framework to make decisions on customer-order decoupling point positioning and improve the supply chain to support mass customization. A test problem of auto parts manufacturing is used to illustrate the efficacy of our framework. The formulation-exploration framework can be used to design a supply chain to facilitate the mass customization of products, especially when information is incomplete and inaccurate (including uncertainties), and goals conflict with each other.

Some studies in this area present mathematical and metaheuristics techniques for modelling supply chain schemes with brief highlights on managerial insights toward the end of publications. Managerial insights often refer to as “so what” where the analysis of investigations should lead to useful understanding for decision making. Managerial insights provide opportunities related to the decision on future events based on sound analysis. There has been limited literature dedicated to the discussion on managerial insights. Since this is an important aspect in any scientific investigation, this presentation aims to revisit the importance of managerial insights for empirical studies on supply chain and logistics planning with carbon emission considerations. Three empirical studies were selected as reference cases: (i) just-in-time (JIT) distribution effects on the environment (carbon emission), (ii) supply chain planning with carbon policies, and (iii) closed-loop supply chain and recovery options. These cases were selected since they were published in reputable ISI journals where the current author is one of the authors for these publications. Modelling and solutions techniques used in these studies are briefly highlighted to provide the context and overview of case scenarios. The managerial insights on the just-in-time logistics approach with frequent transportation of small batch sizes with carbon emission consideration are deliberated. Sensitivity of varying supply chain and logistics parameters with respect to carbon policies are carefully treated to derive useful insights. Due to the importance of sustainability goal in the manufacturing industry, this presentation also provides managerial insights related to the closed-loop supply chain with recovery options. Sensitivity analyses are used to guide decision-makers to evaluate competing cost-benefits among investigated parameters. The importance of having credible test scenarios coupled with scientifically designed experiments cannot be underestimated to ensure the reliability and validity of the insights. Examples of experimental designs and their respective merits are explained. This presentation should promote a better understanding of the importance of managerial insights in performing empirical research on supply chain and logistics. The presentation ends with limitations of managerial insights and suggestions for further investigation. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Carbon emission; Just-in-time; Managerial insights; Recovery options; Supply chain","","Conference paper","Scopus","2-s2.0-85130233278"

We compare different learning rates and discount factors with the generated returns to show the performance of decisions taken by the learning agent. Finally, we experiment proposed model on a case study and benchmark dataset with different values of random seeds to ensure the proposed model framework is more effective over a long time.

With a more demanding market, delivery times have become more competitive. A dynamic amount of inventory is made immediately available at certain points of the manufacturing process, including the final product, allowing to improve the flow of materials and meet more competitive deadlines. This work is particularly interested in optimizing buffer positioning in the context of Demand Driven Material Requirement Planning (DDMRP), where the decision maker can process the location and the sizing of the inventory buffers in complex Bills of materials (BOMs) in the most efficient strategy all while minimizing inventory costs under service time constraint. To do so, an improvement of the existing model of the two first steps of DDMRP: the strategic inventory positioning and calculating the buffer levels, is proposed.

Within the conceptual framework of computational logistics, an attention mechanism oriented hybrid convolutional neural network and recurrent neural network deep learning architecture (AMO-HCR-DLA) is proposed technically to predict the container terminal liner handling conditions that mainly include liner handling time (LHT) and total working time of quay crane farm (TWT-QCF) for a calling liner. Consequently, the container terminal oriented logistics generalized computation (CTO-LGC) automation and intelligence are established tentatively by AMO-HCR-DLA. A typical regional container terminal hub of China is selected to design, implement, execute, and evaluate the AMO-HCR-DLA with the actual production data. In the case of severe vibration of LHT and TWT-QCF, while forecasting the handling conditions of 210 ships based on the CTO-LGC running log of four years, the forecasting error of LHT within one hour is more than 97% and that of TWT-QCF within six hours accounts for 89.405%. When predicting the operating conditions of 300 liners by the log of five years, the forecasting deviation of LHT within one hour is more than striking 99% and that of TWT-QCF within six hours reaches up to 94.010% as well. All are far superior to the predicting outcomes by the classical algorithms of machine learning and deep learning. Hence, the AMO-HCR-DLA shows excellent performance for the prediction of CTHS with the low and stable computational consuming.

Traditional offline scheduling methods are limited in the ability to handle low-volume-high-mix workorders with diverse design specifications. Simulation-based methods show the promise for distributed scheduling of manufacturing jobs but are mostly implemented with historical data and empirical rules in a static manner. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms fuel increasing interests to solve dynamic scheduling problems in the manufacturing setting. However, it's difficult to utilize high-dimensional data for production scheduling while considering multiple practical objectives for smart manufacturing (e.g., minimize the makespan, reduce production costs, balance workloads). Therefore, this paper presents a new AI scheduler with composite reward functions for data-driven dynamic scheduling of manufacturing jobs under uncertainty in a smart factory. Internet-enabled sensor networks are deployed in the smart factory to track real-time statuses of workorders, machines, and material handling systems. A novel manufacturing value network is developed to take high-dimensional data as the input and then learn the state-action values for real-time decision making. Based on reinforcement learning (RL), composite rewards help the AI scheduler learn efficiently to achieve multiple objectives for production scheduling in real time. The proposed methodology is evaluated and validated with experimental studies in a smart manufacturing setting. Experimental results show that the new AI scheduler not only improves the multi-objective performance metrics in the production scheduling problem but also effectively copes with unexpected events (e.g., urgent workorders, machine failures) in manufacturing systems. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","composite reward; neural network; Production scheduling; reinforcement learning; smart factory","Clustering algorithms; Decision making; Engineering education; Flow control; Materials handling; Production control; Real time systems; Reinforcement learning; Scheduling; Sensor networks; Design specification; Distributed scheduling; Dynamic scheduling problems; High dimensional data; Material handling systems; Production Scheduling; Real time decision-making; Simulation-based method; Manufacture","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098775499"

Due to varying routes and a high variance of workpieces, material flows in cyber-physical production systems can get highly complex, which can lead to physically induced disturbances that can result in accidents or decreased throughput and high costs. This issue can be addressed by applying a physics engine to simulate the physical interaction between workpieces and the material handling systems during the operation. Connecting such a digital model to a real material handling system in order to derive simulation-based decision support leads to the concept of digital twins. To date, few practical implementations of digital twins in manufacturing outside the machine tool domain were reported. Therefore, this paper describes the modeling and the subsequent implementation of an integrated system that consists of a real material handling system and its digital twin, based on physics simulation.

Intelligent automation appears as a holistic combination of automation with analytics and decisions made by artificial intelligence, delivering smart manufacturing and mass customization while improving resource efficiency. However, challenges towards the development of intelligent automation architectures include the lack of interoperability between systems, complex data preparation steps, and the inability to deal with both high-frequency and high-volume data in a timely fashion. This paper contributes to industrial frameworks focused on the development of standardized system architectures for Industry 4.0, closing the gap between generic architectures and physical realizations. It proposes a platform for intelligent automation relying on a gateway or middleware between field devices, enterprise databases, and DSSs in real-time scenarios.

While offshoring mainly has been driven by cost aspects, reshoring considers multiple aspects, such as higher quality demands, faster product delivery and product mass-customization. Where to locate manufacturing is usually a purely manual activity that relies on relocation experts, hence, an automated decision-support system would be extremely useful. This paper presents a decision-support system for reshoring decision-making building a fuzzy inference system. The construction and functionality of the fuzzy inference system is briefly outlined and evaluated within a high-cost environment considering six specific reshoring decision criteria, namely cost, quality, time, flexibility, innovation and sustainability. A challenge in fuzzy logic relates to the construction of the so called fuzzy inference rules. In the relocation domain, fuzzy inference rules represent the knowledge and competence of relocation experts and are usually generated manually by the same experts. This paper presents a solution where fuzzy inference rules are automatically generated applying one hundred reshoring scenarios as input data. Another important aspect in fuzzy logic relates to the membership functions. These are mostly manually defined but, in this paper, a semi-Automatic approach is presented. The reshoring decision recommendations produced by the semi-Automatically configured fuzzy inference system are shown to be as accurate as those of a manually configured fuzzy inference system. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Decision-support system; Fuzzy inference rule generation; Fuzzy inference system; Membership function generation; Reshoring","Automation; Computer circuits; Decision making; Decision support systems; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy systems; Sustainable development; Function generation; Fuzzy inference rule generation; Fuzzy inference rules; Fuzzy inference systems; Fuzzy-Logic; Membership function generation; Memberships function; Off-shoring; Reshoring; Rule generation; Membership functions","Conference paper","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098638657"

This study addresses the optimization of risks both in performance and stability for the job shop scheduling under random machine breakdowns, in which three objectives: makespan, makespan risk and stability risk are considered at the same time. The buffering approach under the limited predictive makespan will be proposed and used to generate predictive schedules, which allows inserting additional idle time to control the risks. By utilizing the available information about the relationship between the risks and the random machine breakdowns, we have developed two kinds of operation-block based buffering strategies. In order to meet the decision makers with different risk preferences, a multi-objective predictive scheduling algorithm with the proposed buffering strategies is developed to generate a Pareto solution set. Extensive experimental results indicate that, compared with the existing methods, the proposed method can provide a better Pareto solution set in terms of both the diversity and the convergence. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Job shop; Machine breakdown; Multi-objective; Risk; Robustness; Scheduling","Decision making; Deterioration; Machine shop practice; Manufacture; Optimization; Scheduling; Scheduling algorithms; System stability; Uncertainty analysis; Buffering strategy; Decision makers; Machine breakdown; Manufacturing environments; Performance deterioration; Predictive scheduling; Production system; Uncertain events; Job shop scheduling","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085477534"

Previous job-shop studies based on simulation and multiobjective optimization techniques do not explore the goals that a decision-maker (DM) wishes to reach, when assessing compensations between multiple benefits and potential impacts yielded by a combination of rules. With the aim of reflecting the DM's preference structure on scheduling decisions, this paper considers a discrete event simulation approach integrated with the Flexible and Interactive Tradeoff (FITradeoff) compensatory method to identify the best combination of due date assignment, order release and shop dispatching rules. Through discrete event simulation, the performance of different combinations of rules and inherent parameters are evaluated with regard to the attributes of total cost, production quantity, total throughput time, and tardiness. The FITradeoff method is used to compensate the disadvantage in one of the performance attributes with the advantage in other attributes, considering the DM's preferences which are elicited in a procedure that requires less information in order to make comparisions between multiple simulated consequences.

This article addresses available-to-promise (ATP) in mixed-model assembly line sequencing problems in a Make-To-Order environment in two stages. First, the customers are prioritized based on their corresponding profit values and a decision support system for order acceptance/rejection based on ATP is developed. By implementing this concept and developing a mathematical model, delivery quantity and date in a planning horizon are determined based on the inventories in the stock. The second stage is solving a mixed binary mathematical model to sequence accepted orders suitably according to demands due dates that guarantees the orders are not released too late or too early. The problem simultaneously considers following objectives: minimizing the total tardiness and earliness costs based on the determined priority of orders and minimizing the utility work and idle time of workers in the production line. An algorithm based on Lagrangian relaxation is developed for the problem, and tested in terms of solution quality and computational efficiency. To validate the performance of the proposed algorithm, various test problems in small size are solved using the CPLEX solver, and compared with the Lagrangian relaxation method. Finally, the proposed model is solved in large size problems to analyze the model performance. The drawback of the CPLEX is that it could not solve large problem instances in reasonable time. For the small sized problem, there is approximately 1% duality gap for the Lagrangian relaxation method. The maximum duality gap in the Lagrangian relaxation method for the large sized problem is always kept below 4% while the average computing time is very reasonable. Therefore, according to the results obtained from test problems, the developed Lagrangian relaxation method proved to be the suitable method for this problem. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","ATP; Decision support system; Lagrangian relaxation algorithm; MMAL; MTO; Sequencing","","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077553931"

Due to the lack of top-level design, the data assets in these systems have formed data silos. Under the trend of mass customization production, it is of great significance to combine factory manufacturing data with user data to connect traditional information silos into user-centric intelligent production lines. Traditional offline batch processing tools cannot real-time and automated decision-making in mass customization. Based on the streaming programming model and distributed computing technology, this paper proposes a streaming information integration unit for mass-customized industrial Internet platforms. This unit provides information sharing capabilities in the process of enterprise information management, eliminates information blind spots in the service and workshop layers, and integrates internal information resources of the enterprise. Through the realization of two-way real-time transmission of production information, the user experience is improved and the delivery cycle of mass customization is shortened. In addition, data acquisition tests are performed using factory line temperature sensor data. The experimental results show that compared with the traditional batch processing scheme, the acquisition delay of this scheme is much lower than that of traditional batch processing tools, which provides a feasible solution for information integration in mass customization systems. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","Conference paper","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083015395"

Results: We prove that the graphs’ chromatic numbers in such systems are less than or equal to entire number of dummy nodes applied to the system by means of our proposed algorithm. Furthermore, the presented structure improves the performance of the system by analyzing production bottlenecks. Limitations of the investigations: we only considered the Key Performance Indicators according to products, workstations, and customers. However, the problem can be more generalized by adding some more elements. Practical implications: Our methodology enables managers to assess the performance of the reorganized system after applying the heuristic algorithm, by means of representing a performance evaluation procedure. Originality / Value: We focus on presenting a novel structure to help companies using hybrid make-to-stock (MTS)/make-to-order (MTO) production strategies to (1) identify conflicting workstations and the relations among them, (2) propose dialectical prioritization rules and techniques by means of graph-coloring concepts for resolving the conflicts, (3) reorganize the system, and evaluate performance. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","ConRecognition; Graph Coloring; Heuristic Algorithm; Hybrid Production System","","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147225425"

New tasks of material supply are: integration of supply with the operation of the entire system, especially at the product design stage, effective use of material resources, reduction of the level of supply costs from the point of view of production costs. In the conditions of unit and small batch production the materials requirement needs to be carefully planned and optimized due to the use of many different kinds, types and sizes of materials and dynamic changes of demand over time. In this situation there are needed tools enabling the measurement of production costs for particular tasks on the basis of currently realized processes. One of these tools is activity based costing which is a groundwork for decision making process in the material supply area. Basing on activity based costing, a model of materials requirements planning was developed, which considers minimizing the number of different kinds and sizes of materials by using alternative materials and, consequently, lowering production costs. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","activity based costing; planning of material requirements","","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85082705674"

Due to the complexity of construction products and the rising amount of automation used in the industry, productivity has reached a peak because the process planning of manufacturing activities is still done manually, for example, building information models (BIM) do not provide manufacturing information for construction products. Knowing whether a machine can manufacture a construction product defined by the BIM model is a critical prerequisite for new products. This paper proposes a BIM-based framework for automating the evaluation of machine capabilities for the manufacturing of construction-oriented products. By identifying intersections of the building elements of the product, feasible manufacturing operations are determined, and manufacturing locations are calculated. These locations are then compared to the manufacturing capabilities of the machine. The proposed approach is validated using two wood frame assemblies.

Blockchain-based IoT allows service providers to transfer the security and maintenance responsibility to self-maintaining customers. Adopting peer-to-peer (P2P) networking and computing for more than billions of transactions can reduce the costs arising from the installation and maintenance of centralized systems. Small manufacturers providing industrial IoT (IIoT) services can participate more actively in blockchain-based IIoT applications with three-dimensional printing and digital manufacturing technologies, but the measure to maintain privacy on a blockchain is not robust.

The proposed system consists of reputation management and service architecture. We propose a new reputation assessment method customized to increase the reliability and accuracy of industrial manufacturing systems. We also propose a manufacturer rating classification to guide the customers’ decision making in a reliable manner and a malicious evaluator identification to exclude feedbacks from malicious evaluators. The proposed service architecture is composed of trustless P2P protocols designed for preserving privacy and providing non-repudiation. We used a cryptographic algorithm for ensuring transaction privacy and the digital signing of blockchain for non-repudiation. We also analyzed the proposed service architecture and the possible attack scenarios to verify the security requirements. We verified that the reputation management system was influenced by each feedback dynamically and guided the customer’s present decision making with reliable and classified manners, by simulating reputation classification and malicious evaluator identification.

The advent of mass customization has forced the manufacturing industries to update to Mixed-Model Assembly Lines (MMALs) but at the cost of increased complexity.

This paper investigates the Multi-Criteria Model Sequencing Problem (MC-MSP) using a modified simulation integrated Smart Multi-Criteria Nawaz, Enscore, and Ham (SMC-NEH) algorithm. To address the multiple criteria, a modified simulation integrated Smart Multi-Criteria Nawaz, Enscore, and Ham (SMC-NEH) algorithm was developed by integrating a priori approach with NEH algorithm. Discrete Event Simulation (DES) was used to evaluate each solution. A mathematical model was developed for three criteria: flow time, makespan and idle time. Further, to validate the effectiveness of the proposed SMC-NEH a case study and Taillard's benchmark instances were solved and a Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) analysis was performed to compare the performance of the proposed SMC-NEH algorithm with the traditional NEH algorithm and its variants.

Therefore, manufacturing companies face a relevant risk when taking strategic decisions about which system resources should be acquired. This risk can be mitigated by exploiting performance evaluation models, such as analytical models and Discrete Event Simulation, that are effectively adopted to estimate the performance of possible system configurations. However, current decision-support tools for optimizing system configurations can be only loosely coupled with performance evaluation models, hence undermining the actual optimization of the system itself, even more if production requirements may evolve in the future. This work presents an analytical methodology to support the optimization of manufacturing systems configuration and reconfiguration subject to evolving production requirements. The methodology integrates a stochastic analytical model for performance evaluation of manufacturing lines into a mixed integer programming problem, by means of performance linearization. The advantage of using the proposed methodology is shown on a line configuration problem, where buffer capacities and machine capabilities have to be jointly optimized, in order to minimize costs and satisfy the target performance. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Flexibility; Manufacturing system; Robust optimization; Variability","Analytical models; Decision support systems; Discrete event simulation; Flexible manufacturing systems; Risk perception; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Analytical methodology; Decision support tools; Manufacturing companies; Mixed integer programming; Performance evaluation models; Production requirements; Reconfiguration capability; System configurations; Integer programming","Conference paper","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101085859"

Based on disjunctive graph dispatching, this work proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, that combines the advantages of real-time response and fiexibility of a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) and reinforcement learning (RL), and learns behavior strategies directly according to the input manufacturing states, thus is more appropriate for practical order-oriented manufacturing problems. In this framework, a scheduling process using a disjunction graph is viewed as a multi-stage sequential decision-making problem and a deep CNN is used to approximate the state-action value. The manufacturing states are expressed as multi-channel images and input into the network. Various heuristic rules are used as available actions. By adopting the dueling double Deep Q-network with prioritized replay (DDDQNPR), the RL agent continually interacts with the scheduling environment through trial and error to obtain the best policy of combined actions for each decision step. Static computational experiments are performed on 85 JSSP instances from the well-known OR-Library. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm can obtain optimal solutions for small scale problems, and performs better than any single heuristic rule for large scale problems, with performances comparable to genetic algorithms. To prove the generalization and robustness of our algorithm, the instances with random initial states are used as validation sets during training to select the model with the best generalization ability, and then the performance of the trained policy on scheduling instances with different initial states is tested. The results show that the agent is able to get better solutions adaptively. Meanwhile, some studies on dynamic instances with random processing time are performed and experiment results indicate that out method can achieve comparable performances in dynamic environment in the short run. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adaptive scheduling; Convolutional neural network; Deep reinforcement learning; Dueling double DQN; Job shop scheduling problem (JSSP)","Convolutional neural networks; Decision making; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Engineering education; Genetic algorithms; Heuristic algorithms; Manufacture; Reinforcement learning; Scheduling; Computational experiment; Dynamic environments; Generalization ability; Job shop scheduling problems; Order-oriented manufacturing; Production environments; Sequential decision making; Traditional approaches; Job shop scheduling","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100138902"

Therefore, this study uses simulation to assess POLCA performance in a two-stage production system, where at the first stage parts are manufactured and at the second, they are assembled into end-products. The study demonstrates that using POLCA to control both production stages, manufacturing and assembly, significantly outperforms the use of POLCA at the assembly stage only, leading to important reductions of the total throughput time of orders and on the percentage of tardy orders.

This problem contains a combination of a classical job shop problem with parallel machines (JSPM) to provide flexibility in the production route. Despite the previous studies, the number of parallel machines is not pre-specified in this paper. This constraint with other ones (e.g., sequence-dependent setup times, reentrant workflows, and fuzzy variables) makes the given problem more complex. To solve such a multi-objective JSPM, Pareto-based optimization algorithms based on multi-objective meta-heuristics and multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods are utilized. Then, different comparison metrics (e.g., quality, mean ideal distance, and rate of achievement simultaneously) are used. Also, this paper includes two major phases to provide a new model of the FJSSP and introduce a new proposed HIA for solving the presented model, respectively. This algorithm is a hybrid genetic algorithm with the SAW/TOPSIS method, namely HGASAW/HGATOPSIS.

Prefabricated construction has been adopted as a valuable construction methodology to help achieve mass-customization goals. The concept of product platforms represents a manifestation of mass customization that is a well-known terminology in the manufacturing industry, which is yet to be strongly integrated with the building sector due to various market features surrounding customer demands and product types. The literature suggests that the design work, as a bridge between the customer requirements and the final product, plays a significant role in achieving the market benefits of variety, as well as economic benefits of mass production. However, both customization and standardization of buildings are currently subjective with little consideration to their interactions. These results in suboptimal adoption of mass-customized solutions in building construction. In this research, an integrated framework for a product planning and design platform is introduced which accounts for costs and benefits of various stakeholders over the supply-chain of prefabricated housebuilding projects, i.e., manufacturers, suppliers, logistics parties, designers, construction companies, and customers. The framework utilizes building codes and modular product planning techniques to determine preliminary product architecture. The resulting product architecture is then used as a basis for parametric design optimization with a set of constraints and objective functions specified by different stakeholders along the supply-chain. The stakeholders rely on a common building information modelling platform through which presents terminologies that are utilized in the determination of constraints and objectives.

However, production environment is subject to many sources of uncertainty including machine unavailability periods, which may have a major impact on the production plan. Often times, a production line is interrupted due to periodic repair and preventive maintenance. In addition, machines may become unavailable due to unexpected failures. In many industrial settings unexpected machine failures can be potentially costly as a result of its consequences in terms of machine down times, product quality and client satisfaction. In this context, decision makers may want to jointly optimize the order of the jobs on the machine as well as the maintenance operations considering failures in a production environment such that the total expected makespan is minimized.In this paper, we deal with an integrated optimization model for production scheduling and inspection of a single machine. The failure process of the machine follows a two-stage Delay Time Model (DTM), i.e. it starts with an initial defect, which leads to eventual failure if the defect is left unattended. Once a job is interrupted due to failure on the machine, it must be restarted from the beginning when the machine becomes available. To reduce the risk of machine's breakdown during processing of the jobs, an inspection can be performed prior to start of any job on the machine which exposes down time to the system. We consider the possibility of either minimal repair or replacement of the machine depending on its age at inspection time. We develop a recursive formula to jointly find the optimal inspection policy and production schedule which minimizes the total expected makespan. The problem defined in this paper might be applicable in many industrial and management contexts. Especially when some objective functions such as makespan is of greater importance for the decision makers. We present the application of our proposed model by use of data from a production line consisting of a multiple spindles boring machines which are able to process a number of jobs. We implement a branch and bound algorithm to optimize the model and then evaluate the efficiency of the branch and bound algorithm.

At present, the decision tree reasoning technique and data mining are often used in multi-objective optimization research to solve flexible job shop scheduling issues. Unfortunately, when job shop scheduling problems involve complex logic, it becomes difficult to implement data-driven automatic scheduling without human intervention. Based on the analysis of mass data and specialized knowledge in the scheduling domain, an ontology-based scheduling knowledge model and a method of knowledge representation can be established. Considering the relationship between data mining and knowledge, this paper illustrates the acquisition process of scheduling rules. These scheduling rules were applied to improve the initialization process of the artificial fish algorithm. Then, a scheduling experiment was designed, the results of which show that the efficiency and accuracy of the algorithm has been improved.

The researchers developed a systematic decision-making process that operationalized the first two stages of Goldratt’s drum-buffer-rope methodology. This process was derived from the seminal work of Goldratt, who introduced key insights from the resource-based view and practice-based view strategic perspectives. The process also included original contributions from the authors to understand which purpose should be fulfilled, what decisions should be made and how the process should be applied in an operative way. Design/methodology/approach: Given the practical nature of the research project, action research was an appropriate methodological approach, since this approach aims to contribute to academic research while solving real-world problems. Additionally, the research process complied with necessary criteria to assure the research quality required for action research. Findings: The systematic process was successfully tested by means of a case study on a make-to-order company. This case study answered the research question regarding systematically selecting and exploiting a bottleneck to enhance competitive advantage/firm performance. Originality/value: The key contributions focused on the make-to-order environment and were as it follows: (1) four specific criteria to select the bottleneck, far beyond a load versus capacity perspective (i.e., a strategic perspective inspired by the main concepts of the resource-based view regarding the contribution of strategic resources to sustain competitive advantage). A first case study presenting a partial version of this contribution has been discussed on a previous publication of the authors (Lizarralde, Apaolaza, & Mediavilla, 2019b), which describes the case of production plant of a company dedicated to producing steel tubes by extrusion; (2) a detailed discussion on how to exploit the bottleneck aligned with the practice-based view, which recognised that practices could provide superior performance to organisations; and (3) an overarching systematic process that enables an operative deployment in the specific steps to select strategically the bottleneck and exploit this constraint according to some of Goldratt’s seminal proposals. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Drum-buffer-rope; Make-to-order; Strategic decision; Theory of constraints","","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085955567"

An extended version of the FJSP, entitled sequencing flexibility, is studied in this work, which considers precedence between the operations in the form of a directed acyclic graph instead of a sequential order. In this work, a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation is presented to minimize weighted tardiness for the FJSP with sequencing flexibility. Due to the NP-hardness of the problem, a novel biomimicry hybrid bacterial foraging optimization algorithm (HBFOA) is developed, which is inspired by the behavior of E. coli bacteria in its search for food. The developed HBFOA search method is hybridized with simulated annealing (SA). Additionally, the algorithm has been enhanced by a local search method based on the manipulation of critical operations. Classical dispatching rules have been employed to create the initial swarm of HBFOA, and a new dispatching rule named minimum number of operations has been devised. The developed approach has been packaged in the form of a decision support system (DSS) developed on top of Microsoft Excel—a tool most small and mid-range enterprises (SME) use heavily for planning. A case study with local industry is presented to validate the proposed HBFOA and MILP. Additional numerical experiments using literature benchmarks are further used for validation. The results demonstrate that the HBFOA outperformed the classical dispatching rules and the best integer solution of MILP when minimizing the weighted tardiness and offered comparable results for the makespan instances. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bacterial foraging optimization algorithm; Decision support system; Flexible job-shop scheduling problem; Sequencing-flexibility; Simulated annealing; Weighted tardiness","Artificial intelligence; Biomimetics; Decision support systems; Directed graphs; Escherichia coli; Integer programming; Scheduling; Simulated annealing; Bacterial foraging optimization algorithms; Decision support system (dss); Directed acyclic graph (DAG); Flexible job-shop scheduling problem; Job shop scheduling problems; Mixed-integer linear programming; Sequencing flexibility; Weighted tardiness; Job shop scheduling","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85076473178"

For a certain problem in the real world with more than one objectives, it's hard for decisionmakers to select a certain solution from the well-shaped Pareto Front because the number of solutions could be huge. Thus, obtaining a certain solution or a set of solutions that satisfied the decision-maker most is of significant importance. Knee points are solutions with maximum marginal rates of return on the Pareto Front, which are considered as better options if there are no other preference.

This study is motivated by the production scheduling operations at a television manufacturer, Vestel Electronics. Vestel produces LCD/LED TVs and has a significant market share in the consumer electronics sector in Europe. TV manufacturing is planned based on a make-to-order strategy, and Vestel uses 15 assembly lines to produce 110 different product groups and 3817 different models. Once the orders are received, production scheduling is performed at the beginning of each month, and the goal is to satisfy the demand on time as much as possible. The decision maker has to consider several factors including job-assembly line compatibility, the release and due dates of the jobs and a workload balance among different assembly lines when forming the production schedule. To address this problem, we propose a wide range of heuristics including (i) a sequential algorithm, (ii) a tabu search algorithm, (iii) a random set partitioning approach, and (iv) a novel matheuristic approach utilizing the local intensification and global diversification powers of a tabu search algorithm.

Currently industrial software agents are mainly used for controlling job-shop organized systems, relying on negotiation mechanisms between Product agents and Resource agents. In this paper instead, we aim to develop a distributed production line controller, using agent-based technology for designing decentralized and communicating local state machines. The objective of the study is to obtain a global control system deriving from the interaction and exchange of information between software agents associated with each machine on the production line. The controller implemented has the purpose of eliminating the central infrastructure, generally present in industrial automation systems: the goal is to move the decision-making process locally by associating intelligent entities to each machine. The advantage of decentralization lies in the possibility of having a modular, flexible and reconfigurable line controller concept: indeed, there is no supervisor aware of the entire system to control. The agents can also collaborate for a line detection in case of very complex line without there being statistical evidence of performance deterioration. To validate the functionality of this approach, experimental tests were conducted in a virtual environment. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","distributed control systems; industrial agents; industrial cyber-physical systems; production line controller; reconfigurable manufacturing systems","Automation; Decision making; Deterioration; Industrial electronics; Manufacture; Multi agent systems; Production control; Software agents; Agent based technologies; Decision making process; Distributed productions; Exchange of information; Industrial automation system; Multi-agent technologies; Performance deterioration; Reconfigurable control; Controllers","Conference paper","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083987786"

Business process modelers capture these digital traces to understand the behavior of a system, and to extract actual run-time models of those business processes. Despite the omnipresence of such traces, most organizations face substantial differences between the process specifications and the actual run-time behavior. Analyzing and implementing the results of systems that model business processes tend, however, to be difficult due to the inherent complexity of the models. Moreover, the observed reality in the form of lower-level real-time events, as recorded in event logs, is seldom solely explainable by higher-level process models. In this paper, we propose an architecture to model system-wide behavior by combining process mining with a multi-agent system. Digital traces, in the form of event logs, are used to iteratively mine process models from which agents can learn. The approach is initially applied to a case study of a simplified job-shop factory in which automated guided vehicles (AGVs) carry out transportation tasks.

It is a visual control system that manages the flow of jobs though the shop floor by making use of overlapping loops of cards between pairs of successive manufacturing cells. These overlapping loops of cards realize a decentralized decision-making structure for job release. This means that jobs do not await release in a centralized pre-shop pool. Rather jobs are immediately forwarded to a gateway manufacturing cells at their shop arrival, where they wait in release lists for available POLCA cards. However, the Workload Control literature has shown that using a centralized pre-shop pool provides important benefits. Therefore, this paper investigates the impact of centralized job release on POLCA performance. Using simulation, we demonstrate that centralized job release outperforms decentralised release if the right card acquisition rule for job release is used. This has important implications for both research and practice calling for more research on POLCA systems. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Centralised job release; POLCA; Production Control; Simulation","Control systems; Flexible manufacturing systems; Production control; Centralised; Custom-engineered products; Decentralised; Decentralized decision making; POLCA; Simulation; Visual control; Workload control; Decision making","Conference paper","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078873092"

Product family design environment can be inherently decentralized and requires a number of entities to achieve a common goal. Issues related to product platform design can be modeled as multi-objective optimization with respect to design variables, production cost and other factors. A common drawback in decentralized environments is information sharing which can reduce the quality of the decision especially under partial information or information privacy restrictions. In this paper, we present an agent-based collaborative design model and propose a decentralized coordination mechanism to facilitate decision-making. This is achieved by modeling a collaborative design environment and applying a two-phase augmented Lagrangian-based algorithm such that the decision makers achieve a common goal without having a global view of the entire design space. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed mechanism using a General Aviation Aircraft and a Universal Electric Motor product family design problem. The product designers and the platform designer act independently and each has no knowledge of the decision functions of other designers.

Unfortunately, these benefits cannot be fully realized from industrial energy customers due to inadequate manufacturing decision-making methodology that fails to consider manufacturers and energy suppliers simultaneously. The influence manufacturers have on the grid comes from their large electricity demand contributing to peak power and their large natural gas usage due to the increasing dependency of the electricity sector on gas-fired generation. Nonetheless, the interdependency between manufacturers' electricity and natural gas demand has not been well studied. In this paper, an electricity and natural gas driven production scheduling model for manufacturers is established. The model considers time-based and event-based electricity and gas demand response. A modified simulated annealing (MSA) algorithm is proposed to solve the problem in reaction to real-time supply notifications to promote the interaction between manufacturers and energy providers. Numerical case studies are implemented and illustrate that 66%-68% in energy cost savings for the manufacturer can be achieved when using the proposed model compared to baseline scenarios.

This publication identifies a shortage of deterioration estimation frameworks under time-varying operational conditions as well as a lack of Predictive Maintenance integrated scheduling problems in the literature. Subsequently, a new conceptual framework to model future machine deterioration under time-varying operational conditions and its application in production scheduling is introduced.

This represents a significant gap in the literature, as insights from failed configurator projects could help prevent other companies from making similar mistakes and promote the development of more appropriate methods and tools. To address this gap in the literature, this paper outlines an overall framework for understanding failure in configuration projects. Using this framework, eight failed configurator projects are investigated. These cases demonstrate that poor decision-making in one phase can have escalating negative consequences in the subsequent phases until the configurator project eventually fails.

Anarchic manufacturing delegates decision-making authority and autonomy to the lowest level of entities in system elements with no centralised control or oversight. It is often postulated that traditional hierarchical structures may not be well suited to manage the state-of-the-art hyper-connected smart factories due to their reliance on communication between management layers. Distributed systems, on the other hand, are commonly perceived to be inherently more flexible, robust and adaptable than hierarchical systems due to their structure. This paper characterises distributed systems by evaluating the relative flexibility of a representative hierarchical system against an anarchic system in a job shop scenario. Multi-agent-based simulation is used to model both hierarchical and anarchic systems, which are tested for flexibility following the Taguchi method and compared against Taillard's benchmark job shop problems for overall performance. The results show that the anarchic system performs as well as the hierarchical system when subjected to unforeseen disruption, refuting the argument that hierarchical systems are too rigid and distributed systems are inherently more flexible. However, anarchic manufacturing systems, which show adaptability and self-optimising traits, provide a platform to potentially enable the emerging digital manufacturing paradigm through the free market structure especially when bandwidth for communications is limited. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","distributed systems; flexibility; multi-agent systems; simulation","Benchmarking; Decision making; Job shop scheduling; Manufacture; Multi agent systems; Optimization; Taguchi methods; Digital manufacturing; Distributed planning; Distributed systems; flexibility; Hierarchical structures; Multi agent based simulations; Planning and controlling; simulation; Hierarchical systems","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85053542258"

Various approaches aiming at efficient energy management have been proposed/developed, among which minimizing energy consumption by energy-sensible production scheduling techniques has emerged as a promising one. However, reported workshop models are quite simple and unrealistic. This paper studies a more realistic workshop model called ultra-flexible job shop (uFJS). In an uFJS, the sequence among operations for a job can be changed within certain constraints. To formulate this energy-efficient scheduling problem, a mixed-integer linear programming model was developed. To deal with large-sized problems, a specially designed genetic algorithm (GA) was subsequently proposed and implemented. Numerical results showed the proposed GA worked with decent effectiveness and efficiency. Finally, several comparative studies are carried out to further demonstrate its efficacy in terms of energy efficiency improvement. The advantage of the uFJS as compared to other relative simple workshop models is also shown. By considering the flexibility in operation sequencing in each job, the uFJS effectively integrates process planning and scheduling in discrete parts manufacturing system, thus providing a much larger solution space for more energy-efficient solutions. It therefore provides an excellent platform for decision-makers when developing energy-efficient techniques and strategies. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Discrete parts manufacturing system; Energy efficiency; Genetic algorithm; Mixed-integer linear programming; Production scheduling; Ultra-flexible job shop","Decision making; Energy utilization; Genetic algorithms; Integer programming; Job shop scheduling; Manufacture; Production control; Scheduling; Scheduling algorithms; Effectiveness and efficiencies; Energy efficiency improvements; Energy-Efficient Scheduling; Flexible job shops; Mixed integer linear programming; Mixed integer linear programming model; Process planning and scheduling; Production Scheduling; Energy efficiency","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063864156"

These interventions will cost production managers extra time to schedule orders, which increase much workload and cost of maintenance. On account of this phenomenon, a novel system of data mining–based disturbances prediction for job shop scheduling is proposed. It consists of three modules: data mining module, disturbances prediction module, and manufacturing process module. First, in data mining module, historical data and new data are acquired by radio frequency identification or cable from database, and a hybrid algorithm is used to build a disturbance tree which is utilized as a classifier of disturbances happened before manufacturing. Then, in the disturbances prediction module, a disturbances pattern is built and a decision making will be determined according to the similarity between testing data attributes and mined pattern. Finally, in the manufacturing process module, scheduling will be arranged in advance to avoid the disturbances according to the results of decision making.

This optimisation model is designed to determine the PLT that minimises the inventory holding and shortage costs. Given the unknown distribution of remanufacturing time but with known first and second moments, this model is solved by a min–max approach, which can capture distributions with the same first and second moments. How the PLT and total cost are affected by yield rate with different first and second moments, unit holding cost, unit shortage cost and purchasing lead time are also investigated through numerical examples in this paper.

The environment-conscious Govt. tries to reduce environmental impacts (EIs) of the green products having different greening levels (environment friendliness). At the same time, Govt. makes an effort to generate some specific Govt. net revenue (GNR) from the SC members. The EIs of the products are accounted for based on the amount of carbon emission which determines the greening level of the products. The GNR is generated from the collected taxes and penalty at the trading price for the extra amount of emissions. The Govt. encourages manufacturers to produce greening products by contributing some subsidy. The investigated SC consists of two competitive manufacturers producing separately one of two substitutable greening products and selling to a common retailer by make-to-order business policy. The retailer sells to the customers against their demands based on the selling prices, indirect taxes and greening levels. We develop non-linear bi-level interactive models between the Govt. and SC members. The Govt. is top-level decision maker collecting taxes from retailer paid by customers and paying subsidy/imposing fine to the manufacturers. At the bottom level, there are SC members. The manufacturers horizontally follow Nash-equilibrium and vertically Stackelberg leader-follower decisions among the manufacturers and retailer or cooperating with each other. Finally, numerical experiments are performed on the models and different decisions are derived under nine scenarios. Sensitivity analyses showing the effects of model parameters are presented. It is observed that whoever becomes the leader, his/her profit is maximum amongst the scenarios and within the scenario, who has the highest demand, he/she dominates.

However, it may not be economical by simply scheduling production loads to the periods with lower electricity prices, as these periods often have higher labor wage, e.g., nights and weekends. Based on this gap, this paper proposes a many-objective integrated energy- and labor-aware flexible job shop scheduling model. Many objectives refer to the number of optimization objectives surpasses three (i.e., five objectives: makespan, total energy cost, total labor cost, maximal workload, and total workload), whereas the existing energy-aware production scheduling research is limited within three objectives. To enable energy awareness in the conventional production scheduling algorithms, a state-based shop floor wide energy model is proposed. To enable labor awareness, the number and type of human workers are matched to the scheduled production loads, with varying labor wage over shifts. As one of the most complex shop floor configurations, the partial flexible job shop further considers job recirculation and operation sequence-dependent machine setup times. The recently-proposed nondominated sorting genetic algorithm-III (NSGA-III) is tailored for this many-objective optimization problem (MaOP), including scheduling solution encoding and decoding, crossover, mutation, and solution evaluation using the energy- and labor-aware discrete-event simulation framework. Through numerical experiments under real-time pricing (RTP) and time-of-use pricing (ToUP), insights are statistically obtained on the relation among these five production objectives; the effectiveness and efficiency of NSGA-III in solving a MaOP are also demonstrated. This proposed scheduling method can be used to automated and enhance the decision making of factory managers in jointly allocating machine, human worker, and energy resources on the shop floor, such that the production cost is minimized even under time-varying electricity and labor prices. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Demand response; Evolutionary computation; Labor scheduling; Many-objective optimization; Sustainable production scheduling","Costs; Decision making; Discrete event simulation; Electric power transmission networks; Energy resources; Energy utilization; Evolutionary algorithms; Floors; Genetic algorithms; Human resource management; Power management; Power markets; Production control; Scheduling; Scheduling algorithms; Smart power grids; Wages; Demand response; Effectiveness and efficiencies; Encoding and decoding; Flexible job-shop scheduling; Many-objective optimizations; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Numerical experiments; Sustainable production; Job shop scheduling","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85056000918"

This is possible by the integration of customers into value generation processes by defining, configuring, or modifying individual solutions from of a list of pre-defined options. Therefore, the success of MC depends on companycustomer interactions. Choice menu (CM) is one of the possible interfaces between a company and its customers, aiming to guide them through a set of decisions. In the residential building industry, a major barrier for offering customised products is the lack of an internal structured process to guide all decisions involved in product configuration. The scope of this paper is the overall customisation process, from the definition of the solution space until the offer of different alternatives to customers. The main contribution of this investigation is a set of guidelines for the developing of a choice menu through the decision making process involved in the delivery of customised residential building projects. It is based on an on-going empirical study carried out in a Brazilian company. The results indicate that the reductionist approaches often found in the literature on the role of choice menus tends to be ineffective in the residential building market, and suggest that a holistic view of MC is necessary. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Choice Menu; Mass Customisation; Residential Projects, Service Blueprint","","Conference paper","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128172328"

Nowadays, globalization requires companies to achieve high levels of production efficiency in order to compete advantageously on both domestic and international markets. In this paper, we consider an Italian company operating in the food sector, which produces multiple products and some of them are highly perishable. The production is usually planned using a short-term view, the production line can be re-equipped according to the product to be manufactured and set-up times are sequence-dependent. The limited production capacity of the industrial plant and some organizational inefficiencies determine significant effects on customer orders, which are often rejected. The contribution concerns a mathematical framework to support the scheduling of the production activities at operational level. In fact, the limited company budget does not allow strategic investments. The developed decision-making approach acquires a set of customer orders as input and outputs a production plan which mainly answers the following questions: what to produce, how much to produce and in what period of time to produce, in order to maximize conflicting objectives. Starting from some theoretical assumptions, our approach is validated using real data.

Because of the particularities of the recovery and production processes, remanufacturing is seriously affected by the uncertainty of the production process, which also affects the remanufacturing choice of enterprises. In this paper, we focus on the case where a make-to-order type manufacturer is confronted with the strategic option of obtaining core materials by self-remanufacturing or outsourcing new cores. Through a stochastic modelling approach, a two-echelon closed-loop supply chain is constructed to capture the manufacturer's sourcing strategy and production planning by considering yield uncertainty in both the remanufacturing and production stages. We first examine the case of a deterministic recovery rate. The results show that regardless of whether the firm chooses to remanufacture or buy new core materials, the expected profit of the (re)manufacturer is always concave. Then, in the case of a random recovery rate, we show that the distribution bounds are important and play key roles in deciding the strategic option of self-remanufacturing or outsourcing. By comparing the upper and lower bounds of the recovery rate with the procurement cost of new raw material and used product, three production/sourcing strategies, namely, using remanufactured cores only, outsourcing new material only and jointly using the two materials, are investigated. The optimal procurement quantity and the optimal production input are derived to maximize the (re)manufacturer's expected profits under the three scenarios. Finally, we perform sensitivity analysis of the impact of yield uncertainty on the optimal results. The results show that when the shortage cost increases, the collection quantity increases faster than the production input, which implies that a 'bullwhip effect' exists in the proposed two-period collection and production system. The conclusions of this paper can be applied to remanufacturing in related enterprises to provide production and procurement decision support for managers and to promote the efficiency of closed-loop supply chains. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","outsourcing; recovery rate; Remanufacturing; yield uncertainty","Coremaking; Costs; Decision support systems; Outsourcing; Production control; Profitability; Recovery; Sensitivity analysis; Stochastic systems; Strategic materials; Supply chains; Closed-loop supply chain; Hybrid manufacturing systems; Manufacturing industries; Procurement decisions; Recovery rate; Remanufacturing; Upper and lower bounds; yield uncertainty; Uncertainty analysis","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078359041"

The press-shop consists of 32 work stations and can process a maximum of 115 job variants according to the monthly demand. The jobs are processed based on their sequence of operation. The main objective of this paper is to develop a realistic simulation model of the shop floor and to evaluate its performance measures using Priority Dispatching Rules (PDRs). Static PDRs and Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) approach are used in this study to evaluate the performance of the press-shop. Simulation model of the press-shop has been developed using Discrete Event Simulation (DES) package 'ARENA'. The proposed simulation model is integrated with an innovative application of MCDM approach to prioritize the jobs using 'Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution' (TOPSIS) approach. Results indicate that the proposed TOPSIS approach performs better when compared to some of the popular PDRs considered in this study. The proposed approach can reduce the makespan value by an average of 13.75% compared with the actual data available on the shop floor. The better performance is due to the multi-criterion approach implemented for job prioritization. The proposed MCDM approach is simple and easily integrated with real-time environment. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Discrete event simulation (DES); Job shop; Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM); Priority dispatching rules (PDRs); TOPSIS","Decision making; Discrete event simulation; Floors; Job shop scheduling; Job shop; Job shop environment; Multi-criteria decision making; Priority dispatching rules; Real-time environment; Realistic simulation; Sequencing and scheduling; TOPSIS; Presses (machine tools)","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077777136"

In DFJSS, it is critical to make two kinds of real-time decisions (i.e. the routing decision that assigns machine to each job and the sequencing decision that prioritises the jobs in a machine’s queue) effectively in the dynamic environment with unpredicted events such as new job arrivals and machine breakdowns. Dispatching rule is an ideal technique for this purpose. In DFJSS, one has to design a routing rule and a sequencing rule for making the two kinds of decisions. Manually designing these rules is time consuming and requires human expertise which is not always available. Genetic programming (GP) has been applied to automatically evolve more effective rules than the manually designed ones. In GP for DFJSS, different features in the terminal set have different contributions to the decision making. However, the current GP approaches cannot perfectly find proper combinations between the features in accordance with their contributions. In this paper, we propose a new representation for GP that better considers the different contributions of different features and combines them in a sophisticated way, thus to evolve more effective rules. The results show that the proposed GP approach can achieve significantly better performance than the baseline GP in a range of job shop scenarios. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dispatching rules; Dynamic flexible job shop scheduling; Genetic programming; Representation","Combinatorial optimization; Decision making; Genetic algorithms; Genetic programming; Scheduling; Dispatching rules; Dynamic environments; Flexible job-shop scheduling; Machine breakdown; Real time decisions; Representation; Routing decisions; Sequencing rules; Job shop scheduling","Conference paper","Scopus","2-s2.0-85064934732"

The DSS can work with all dispatching rules. To analyze its effects, it is run with popular dispatching rules selected from the literature on a simulation model created in Arena®. When the number of jobs waiting in the queue of any workstation in the job-shop falls to a critical value, the DSS can change the order of schedules in its preceding workstations to feed the workstation as soon as possible. For this purpose, it first determines the jobs in the preceding workstations to be sent to the current workstation, then finds the job with the highest priority number according to the active dispatching rule, and lastly puts this job in the first position in its queue. The DSS is tested under low, normal, and high demand rate scenarios with respect to six performance criteria. It is observed that the DSS improves the system performance by increasing workstation utilization and decreasing both the number of tardy jobs and the amount of waiting time regardless of the employed dispatching rule. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Decision support systems; Dynamic job-shop scheduling; Industry 4.0; Internet of things; Simulation","","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85063881542"

Although it is possible to improve efficiency applying new and more efficient machines, decision makers tend to look for some less expensive alternatives. In this context, the adoption of more efficient strategies during the production planning can allow the reduction in energy consumption and associated emissions. Furthermore, the current reality of manufacturing companies, brought by Industry 4.0 concepts, requires more flexibility of production systems, thus, increasing complexity for machine rescheduling without compromising sustainable requirements. In this paper, we propose a method to predict total energy consumption in job shop systems applying machine learning techniques. Different schedules may result in different consumption rates. However, there is a nonlinear relationship between these targets. Therefore, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is applied for a quick estimation of total energy consumption. In order to validate the model, computational experiments, using digital manufacturing software tools, are performed on different job shop configurations to show the efficiency of the proposed model. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Decision making; Energy utilization; Industrial electronics; Job shop scheduling; Machine learning; Manufacture; Neural networks; Production control; Computational experiment; Job-shop configuration; Machine learning approaches; Machine learning techniques; Manufacturing companies; Non-linear relationships; Reduction in energy consumption; Total energy consumption; Energy efficiency","Conference paper","Scopus","2-s2.0-85061559506"

Most small and medium-sized enterprises are representatives of the MTO group. This results from a shorter product life time due to the changing expectations of customers. This, in turn, contributes to the separation of R & D departments in organizational structures of enterprises and close cooperation between industry and research units specializing in the field of operation of a given producer. More and more products are designed to be unique so as to suit client's requirements. Similarly, the process of manufacturing such a product will be unique. From the point of view of management, the preparation of production and the production itself in this case has more features of a project-type task than typical production. Many enterprises, in particular small and medium-sized ones, the activity of which is flexible in terms of the offered products create a hybrid system encompassing series production, single-batch production and projects. The article presents a new approach to the topic of scheduling in such hybrid systems combining MTS, Projects and MTO. The presented method of scheduling is based on the assumptions of the Theory of Constraints. In small and medium-sized enterprises, which fight for every order, it is necessary to use production scheduling methods that are characterized by flexibility, transparency and reasonably low labour intensity, taking into account numerous resource constraints involved in production in a hybrid system. In this system we face a decision-making process which forces us to answer the question: can a new order be accepted to be fulfilled in a strictly defined deadline. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Decision making; Production control; Scheduling; Decision making process; Organizational structures; Production Planning; Production Scheduling; Resource Constraint; Resource planning; Small and medium sized enterprise; Theory of constraint; Hybrid systems","Conference paper","Scopus","2-s2.0-85055803333"

They concern all stages of manufacturing activity - order acceptance, products design, processes planning and jobs scheduling. Such decision consists in selecting, at a given moment, the most suitable alternative of the potential ones. This means that comparative assessment of potential alternatives is required. The usual method underpinning the comparative assessment supposes the direct, separate evaluation of each alternative, before decision making. In this paper we suggest a different approach in performing the comparative assessment, based on alternatives rankings, considered as the most relevant information about them. More specific, this means that rankings are assigned to potential alternatives, by referring them to the cases of already performed manufacturing activities, recorded as past instances database, after ranking criteria such as cost, time span, consumed energy etc. Thus, the selection decision results by comparing potential alternatives rankings. For finding the ranking of a given alternative, a solution to assess the difference between instances is needed, at first. Then, after iteratively defining instances neighborhoods from database and modeling them by multiple nonlinear regression, its ranking is determined. Here, we propose an expression for the distance-function together with an algorithm for actually finding the ranking of the analyzed alternative. A numerical simulation for the instance-based comparative assessment, with the help of an instances artificial database is also presented. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Database systems; Iterative methods; Manufacture; Product design; Comparative assessment; Consumed energy; Distance functions; Jobs scheduling; Manufacturing activities; Multiple nonlinear regression; Order acceptance; Selection decisions; Decision making","Conference paper","Scopus","2-s2.0-85055771456"

To facilitate this task, we propose a mathematical model-based decision tool to support the order promising process according to product homogeneity requirements in hybrid Make-To-Stock (MTS) and Make-To-Order (MTO) contexts. In these manufacturing environments, the comparison of Available-To-Promise (ATP) and/or Capable-To-Promise (CTP) quantities with homogeneous ones ordered by customers is necessary during the order commitment. To properly deal with customers’ product uniformity requirements, different ATP consumption rules are implemented by defining a novel objective function. CTP modelling in these systems also entails having to address new aspects, such as estimating future homogeneous quantities in additional lots to the master plan, accomplishing minimum lot sizes and saving in setups when programming new lots. By including CTP in the order promising model, a closer integration with the master production schedule is achieved. The resulting mathematical model was applied to a ceramic tile company in different supply scenarios and execution modes, and at several availability levels (ATP and ATP&CTP). The results validate model performance and provide insights into the impact of ATP consumption rules on the profits made from committed customer orders in different scenarios for the specific ceramic tile company. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Available-to-promise; Capable-to-promise; Customer homogeneity requirement; Hybrid MTS-MTO; Mixed integer linear programming; Order promising process","Ceramic materials; Integer programming; Manufacture; Production control; Sales; Available-to-promise; Capable to promise; Customer homogeneity requirement; Hybrid MTS-MTO; Mixed integer linear programming; Order promising; Decision support systems","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85048162212"

The analysis of the big data with uncertain information that influences the assembly objectives can be helpful to improve the capacity of resisting the disturbance of the scheduling system and realize the optimal production. This paper focuses on the analysis and utilization of assembly big data in the manufacturing process and studies the key technologies of big data analysis and assembly scheduling optimization for complex equipment. A big data analysis and scheduling optimization system is proposed to solve the assembly service execution decision for complex equipment. It proposes to analyze the assembly big data and make decisions with uncertain information by locally linear embedding, adaptive boosting, support vector machine, and D-S evidence theory. In order to explore the influence pattern of assembly task and environment on assembly efficiency, the neural industrial engineering is proposed to be introduced into human error prediction based on physiological big data. Finally, the variable metric clustering of assembly tasks can be provided to ensure the maximization of assembly efficiency and the production balance. The proposed system can effectively handle the dynamic and uncertain information in the assembly, and get better overall scheduling optimization of the assembly system.

Drivers such as mass customization strategies, high part-complexity needs, shorter product development cycles, a large pool of materials to choose from, abundant manufacturing processes, diverse streams of applications (e.g. aerospace, motor vehicles, and health care) and high cost incurred due to manufacturability of the part have made it essential to choose the right compromise of materials, manufacturing processes and associated machines in early stages of design considering the Design for Additive Manufacturing guidelines. There exists a complex relationship between AM products and their process data. However, the literature to-date shows very less studies targeting this integration. As several criteria, material attributes and process functionality requirements are involved for decision making in the industries, this paper introduces a generic decision methodology, based on multi-criteria decision-making tools, that will not only provide a set of compromised AM materials, processes and machines but will also act as a guideline for designers to achieve a strong foothold in the AM industry by providing practical solutions containing design oriented and feasible material-machine combinations from a current database of 38 renowned AM vendors in the world.

Because of the high efficiency and high quality operation, the industrial robots (IRs) have been deployed in various industries, and the energy-efficient operation of IRs has become the focus of attention. Among this, the energy-efficient assessment of IRs operation performance can grasp the energy status and the manufacturing capacity during the production process. In addition, there is a close relationship between the production line level and the manufacturing cell level. From the view of manufacturing systems in a job shop, the concurrent assessment of IRs' operation performance will provide the support for the optimization of operation control and scheduling decision making as a whole.

A set of concurrent assessment model is established based on the relationship between the IRs production line level and the manufacturing cell level. A mining algorithm is used to mine association rules between the indicators. Furthermore, in order to improve the accuracy of the concurrent assessment, the correlation coefficient based on association rules between the indicators is used to correct the weights.

Job shops with a high mix of frequently changing part requiraments and contract manufacturers running high volumes of the same or similar parts operate at different ends of the manufacturing spectrum.

The aim of this article is to develop a method for managing the production line where it is possible to produce an entire spectrum of products without reconfiguring the production line. An illustrative example is the production of fruit yoghurt of various types. The entire life cycle of the product is monitored and documentation of all relevant raw material data is carried out through the production process all the way to product packaging where each product is specifically marked with QR code. A special technique for deciding on optimum maintenance of the production line has been introduced and a multi-criteria decision model has been developed using the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process method where it is possible to achieve a high degree of minimization of maintenance costs. In this work, a fuzzy-based multi-criteria decision making methodology is developed for conceptual design evaluation in the cost reduction in maintenance of mass customization process.

These cells normally benefit from a mobile robot which serves the machines according to a given schedule. One of the main problems of such companies is finding the order of robot moves in a way that the time required for completing all jobs is minimized. In the studied case in this research, each cell contains three machines of which, two or three of them might be activated for production process depending on the product type. These machines are equipped with a one-capacitated input and output buffer. Considering the fact that the machines are capable of performing any operation, the assignments of the jobs to them may have several alternatives. The one-capacitated buffers make the robot scheduling more complex as they act as extra stations to be served by the robot (contribute to exponential increase in job assignments permutation). This study aims to deal with this complexity and provide a decision-making toolbox for business owners to determine and employ the best robot moving schedule according to the characteristics of the problem. The mentioned approach significantly contributes to decision-maker’s effective time management and results in adopting a better production scheme for each production cycle. In line with this prospect, this research proposes a sequential part production matrix (SPPM) to determine feasible robot move strategies through which the best scheduling scheme is introduced for different problem configurations. Additionally, a metaheuristic algorithm is proposed to determine the best robot move strategy for cases with more active machines in a cell as manual determination of the robot move strategies becomes exhaustive in such cases. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cellular manufacturing system; Mobile robot cellular scheduling; Production scheduling; Robot cyclic move","Cells; Cellular manufacturing; Cytology; Decision making; Manufacture; Mobile robots; Production control; Robots; Scheduling; Exponential increase; Input and outputs; Meta heuristic algorithm; Production process; Production Scheduling; Production schemes; Production system; Scheduling schemes; Job shop scheduling","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85039699175"

All decision areas follow the same pattern, i.e. full centralisation, full decentralisation or full integration. We do not find any support for that some decisions are centralised while others are decentralised. Product volume and process type are significantly associated with the choice of decision-making structure. In particular, high product volumes are associated with a centralised approach, and a low degree of process flow orientation (such as project manufacturing, job shop and flow shop) is associated with a decentralised approach. The integrated approach is associated with a combination of lower product volumes and higher degrees of flow orientation.

Designs have been proposed with different positioning, creating confusion in concepts and supporting technologies.

One goal of this scheduling is to minimize the number of operators and airframes that are needed in the assembly line. Minimizing the number of airframes in the assembly line, which is particularly important due to the cost of each airframe, is generally ignored in production planning models that are used in prior studies. Moreover, the output of the program refers to a set of schedules that includes different combinations of number of operators and intermediate stock, to enable a better decision making. A mixed integer linear programming model is presented to solve this problem. Experimentation was conducted using real-life examples from the aeronautical industry. The solutions that are presented in this paper outperformed current industrial methods in both quality and calculation time. To the best of our knowledge, this variant has not been addressed in prior studies either in scheduling or in aeronautics contexts. However, minimizing the number of operators and intermediate stock could have significant implications for numerous labor intensive industries, contributing to enhanced and more agile decision making processes. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","aeronautical industry; Case Study; flexible job shop with operators; mixed integer linear programming","Aircraft; Aircraft manufacture; Airframes; Assembly; Assembly machines; Decision making; Fixtures (tooling); Industry; Integer programming; Manufacture; Optimization; Production control; Scheduling; Structural frames; Agile decision makings; Atmospheric model; Flexible job shops; Flexible job-shop scheduling; Flexible job-shop scheduling problem; Minimizing the number of; Mixed integer linear programming; Mixed integer linear programming model; Job shop scheduling","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85041775774"

It considers the quantity and date of parts’ order as decision variables to make the problem seem more realistic. A mixed-integer linear programming model is proposed to minimize sum of the total weighted completion time, parts ordering and holding cost. A genetic algorithm (GA) based heuristic is proposed to solve the problem efficiently since it is NP-hard, whose solutions are compared with those of CPLEX. Computational experiments were conducted through a diverse range of problem instances indicating that the GA performs much better than CPLEX regarding the average percentage of improvement, ranging from 2.96% to 37.70%, and CPU time. The existing study has considered the effect of machine specific and shared parts aligned with integrated decisions. Results indicate that, adding more of both specific and shared parts and increasing the number of jobs lead to dramatic decrease in the performance of CPLEX in comparison with GA. As the results reveal, the integrated model provides enhancements for the supply chain performance up to 8.16%. Furthermore, the permutation and non-permutation types of the problem are analyzed. The obtained Results show that permutation schedules are not sufficient to solve two-stage assembly scheduling problem within inventory constraints. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Genetic algorithm; Inventory; Mixed-integer linear programming; Scheduling; Two-stage assembly problem","Assembly; Decision making; Genetic algorithms; Integer programming; Job shop scheduling; Scheduling; Supply chains; Assembly problems; Assembly-scheduling problems; Computational experiment; Integrated decision makings; Inventory; Mixed integer linear programming; Mixed integer linear programming model; Total weighted completion time; Problem solving","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85038871891"

However, the uncertainties (such as component supplies) in product configuration setting are not considered in the existing product configurators. To handle the uncertainty in component replenishment lead-time, a new stochastic decision model is proposed in this paper using two-stage stochastic programming approach. Further, a pre-procuring strategy for component supply is employed to reduce total configuration costs and shorten the delivery date of customized products. The stochastic decision model for product configuration is solved by using Lagrangian relaxation algorithm. The effectiveness of the stochastic decision model is demonstrated through case studies from both computer configuration and ranger drilling machine configuration.

One of the emerging paradigms concerned with these characteristics is reconfigurable manufacturing systems (RMSs). The high responsiveness and performance efficiencies of RMS make it a convenient manufacturing paradigm for and flexible enabler of mass customization. The RMS offers customized flexibility and a variety of alternatives as features thanks to its reconfigurable machine tool (RMT). These machines represent a major component of RMS and are based on an adjustable, modular and reconfigurable structure. Hence, the system modularity is of great importance. This paper outlines a multi-objective approach to optimize the RMS design. Three objectives are considered: the maximization of the system modularity, the minimization of the system completion time and the minimization of the system cost. We developed a modularity-based multi-objective approach that uses an adapted version of the “Archived Multi-Objective Simulated Annealing” (AMOSA) method to solve the optimization problem by selecting from a set of candidate machines the most suitable ones. Implemented, the decision maker can use a multi-objective decision making tool based on the well-known “Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution” (TOPSIS) to choose the best solution in the Pareto front according to his preferences. We demonstrated the applicability of the proposed approach through an illustrative example and an analysis of the obtained numerical results. © 2017 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","AMOSA; Machine selection; Modularity index; Performance metrics; Process plan; Reconfigurable manufacturing systems; System design; TOPSIS","Computer aided manufacturing; Decision making; Machine tools; Optimization; Simulated annealing; Systems analysis; AMOSA; Machine selection; Modularity index; Performance metrics; Process plan; Reconfigurable manufacturing system; TOPSIS; Manufacture","Article","Scopus","2-s2.0-85027724552"
